# Legion Changelog

## [1.9.42] - 2026-06-07

### Performance
- Extensions: batched extension registration into a single `LexRegister` publish after all extensions load, eliminating N individual queue messages and DB transactions during boot
- Removed redundant `flush_pending_registrations!` call from `setup_identity` ensure block, consolidating to a single flush point in `reload!`

## [1.9.41] - 2026-06-02

### Fixed
- CLI: `setup proxy-mode` now upserts `[model_providers.legionio]` with `api_key = "legion"` into `~/.codex/config.toml` instead of writing the deprecated `profile = "legionio"` key (removed by Codex)
- CLI: model catalog format corrected to use `slug`/`display_name`/`supported_reasoning_levels` fields
- CLI: `model_catalog_json` removed from top-level `config.toml` (breaks Mac app strict schema parsing); kept only in `legionio.config.toml` for `--profile legionio` CLI use

## [1.9.40] - 2026-06-01

### Added
- 

## [1.9.39] - 2026-05-30

### Fixed
- CLI: remove `--clear-sources` from `gem install` in bootstrap and setup commands (breaks pack reinstall when custom sources are configured)

## [1.9.38] - 2026-05-30

### Fixed
- Gemspec: require legion-llm >= 0.10.1 (message translation, streaming, curator fixes required for Claude Code and Codex CLI agentic tool loops via vLLM)

## [1.9.37] - 2026-05-29

### Added
- LLM: namespace API enabled by default — LegionIO now routes all `/v1/` and `/api/llm/` traffic
  through `Namespaces::Registration` (Sinatra::Namespace, Phases 0-4 complete in legion-llm ≥ 0.8.50)
- CLI: `legion setup proxy-mode` (alias: `proxy`) writes `~/.codex/config.toml` and
  `~/.claude/settings.json` env block so Codex CLI and Claude Code connect to LegionIO at
  `http://localhost:4567` out of the box. Supports `--port`, `--host`, `--force`, `--json`.

### Fixed
- LLM: Anthropic namespace message translation now properly converts `tool_use`/`tool_result` content blocks to OpenAI format for vLLM dispatch (requires legion-llm ≥ 0.10.1)
- LLM: streaming tool_use blocks emitted inline with guaranteed ordering before `message_stop`
- LLM: curator preserves recent turns — no longer curates tool results from the current/previous turn

## [1.9.36] - 2026-05-22

### Fixed
- Identity: preload identity provider gems and resolve process identity before LLM setup so `llm.registry` availability events include Legion identity headers.
- Identity: use the persisted `identity.json` value as a cached resolver fallback ahead of unverified system identity when fresh auth providers are unavailable.
- Bundler: load sibling Legion and LLM provider path dependencies outside the test group when those local checkouts exist, so local service boots can use the active workspace gems.

## [1.9.35] - 2026-05-22

### Added
- CLI: `legionio service start|stop|restart|status` subcommand for direct launchd control
- Logging transport forwarding now publishes structured log headers/properties, including identity and Legion version headers supplied by `legion-logging`.

### Fixed
- CLI: `legionio bootstrap --start` now calls `launchctl kickstart` after brew services start to force immediate spawn on macOS 26+ (Tahoe defers `RunAtLoad` for mid-session bootstraps)

## [1.9.34] - 2026-05-18

### Added
- API: `GET /api/extensions/tools` endpoint with extension, runner, deferred, and triggered filters
- Tools::Discovery: writes to `Legion::Settings::Extensions.register_tool` (bridges discovery to LLM pipeline)

### Fixed
- Extensions: `extension_parts_from_const` no longer converts underscores to dashes (fixes lex-microsoft_teams filtering)
- Core: `generate_runner_messages` strips `?` and `!` from method names before creating constants

## [1.9.33] - 2026-05-15

### Added
- `Legion::Identity::Process` stores and exposes `db_principal_id` and `db_identity_id` integer PKs — present in `EMPTY_STATE`, persisted through `bind!`, and included in `identity_hash`. Both default to nil until an identity provider populates them.

## [1.9.32] - 2026-05-14

### Removed
- Removed `gem 'ruby_llm'` dependency from Gemfile; all 40 CLI chat tools now use `Legion::Tools::Base` natively.

### Changed
- Migrated all 40 CLI chat tool classes from `RubyLLM::Tool` to `Legion::Tools::Base`:
  - `param` DSL replaced with `input_schema` (JSON Schema hash)
  - `def execute` instance method replaced with `def self.call` class method
  - Explicit `tool_name 'legion.<snake_case>'` added to each tool
  - Private instance helpers converted to class methods
- Updated `tool_registry.rb`: removed `require 'ruby_llm'` and `begin/rescue LoadError` guard.
- Updated `extension_tool_loader.rb`: `klass < RubyLLM::Tool` changed to `klass < Legion::Tools::Base`.
- Updated `generate_command.rb` tool template to emit `Legion::Tools::Base` with `input_schema` and `def self.call`.
- `Permissions::Gate` now prepends on the singleton class to intercept `self.call` correctly.

## [1.9.31] - 2026-05-14

### Added
- `GET /api/identity` endpoint returning live process identity, provider resolution status, and registered provider metadata.
- `autobuild_submodules` recursive walk in `Legion::Extensions` — nested sub-modules (e.g. `Delegated`, `Application`, `ManagedIdentity`, `WorkloadIdentity` inside `lex-identity-entra`) now have their actors autobuilt and started.

### Fixed
- `Extensions::Helpers::Base#full_path` now walks up gem name segments to find the parent gem when a sub-module gem doesn't exist as a standalone gem (e.g. `lex-identity-entra-delegated`).

## [1.9.30] - 2026-05-12

### Changed
- Slimmed agentic pack to only cognitive/coordination extensions; removed non-agentic gems (`lex-audit`, `lex-autofix`, `lex-codegen`, `lex-cost-scanner`, `lex-dataset`, `lex-factory`, `lex-finops`, `lex-governance`, `lex-llm-ledger`, `lex-onboard`, `lex-pilot-infra-monitor`, `lex-pilot-knowledge-assist`, `lex-prompt`, `lex-react`, `lex-swarm`, `lex-swarm-github`, `lex-transformer`).
- Added `legion-mcp` to the LLM pack.
- Added `lex-kerberos` to the identity pack.
- Added new `developer` pack: `lex-developer`, `lex-dynatrace`, `lex-eval`, `lex-exec`, `lex-github`, `lex-http`, `lex-jfrog`, `lex-skill-superpowers`, `lex-ssh`.

## [1.9.29] - 2026-05-11

### Fixed
- `Subscription#activate` now checks `channel.open?` before calling `subscribe_with`; if closed, it re-prepares once and retries, preventing silent activation failures when a channel is closed between prepare and activate.
- `Transport` mixin now guards `auto_create_dlx_exchange` and `auto_create_dlx_queue` with a `remote_invocable?` check — non-remote extensions no longer attempt to create dead-letter exchanges and queues they never use.
- DLX exchange type corrected from `fanout` to `topic` for consistency with the rest of the exchange topology.
- Identity resolver DB persistence now uses Sequel models (`Identity::Provider`, `Identity::Principal`, `Identity::Identity`, `Identity::AuditLog`) instead of raw `Legion::Data.db` dataset calls that didn't exist on the module.
- Identity audit API endpoint now references correct column names (`detail_payload`, `node_ref`, `session_ref`) matching the schema.
- Fixed `LeaseRenewer#log_renewal_failure` to fall back to `$stderr` when `Legion::Logging` is not yet loaded, matching the original contract.
- Fixed `Legion::Service#log_privacy_mode_status`, `#shutdown_component`, and TLS-fallback logging specs to assert against `emit_tagged` (the actual dispatch path used by `Legion::Logging::Helper`) rather than `Legion::Logging.warn/info` directly.
- Fixed `Cluster::Leader` boot integration spec to stub `Legion::Settings[:logging]` so `log` helper initialization does not raise on unexpectedly-received arguments.

### Changed
- Added `remote_invocable_extension?` helper to the `Transport` module; returns `lex_class.remote_invocable?` when available, `true` otherwise.
- Refactored `Identity::Resolver#persist_to_db` into extracted helpers (`upsert_providers`, `upsert_principal`, `upsert_identities`, `upsert_single_identity`) to reduce method complexity and improve readability.
- Replaced hand-rolled `log_warn`/`log_debug` methods in `Identity::Resolver`, `Identity::Broker`, and `Identity::LeaseRenewer` with `include Legion::Logging::Helper` and standard `log.debug`/`log.warn` calls.
- Added debug logging throughout `Identity::Resolver` for registration, resolution, auth racing, binding, and DB persistence.
- LLM inference API now passes `instance` and `tier` routing hints from request body through to `Legion::LLM::Inference::Request`.

## [1.9.28] - 2026-05-08

### Fixed
- Task outcome observation now ignores internal runner completions without task ids, preventing periodic mesh gossip ticks from feeding meta-learning and Apollo ingestion.
- Identity resolver database persistence now targets the current identity provider, principal, identity, and audit log schema.

## [1.9.27] - 2026-05-08

### Fixed
- Preserve omitted `/api/llm/inference` client tool definitions as absent instead of `tools: []`, allowing legion-llm registry and trigger-based tool injection to run for normal API requests.
- Added an opt-in live daemon integration spec suite that uses explicit Faraday test dependencies and its own isolated RSpec helper.

## [1.9.26] - 2026-05-07

### Fixed
- Use the local `Legion::Identity::Process` identity for unauthenticated loopback API principals even when the process is only fallback-bound, avoiding generic `system:system` attribution in downstream LLM audit flows.

## [1.9.25] - 2026-05-07

### Fixed
- Updated identity model references in `identity_audit.rb` and `identity/broker.rb` to use the portable namespace (`Identity::AuditLog`, `Identity::Principal`, `Identity::GroupMembership`) after legacy top-level identity models were removed from legion-data.

## [1.9.24] - 2026-05-07

### Changed
- Removed deprecated direct AI provider extensions (`lex-azure-ai`, `lex-bedrock`, `lex-claude`, `lex-foundry`, `lex-gemini`, `lex-ollama`, `lex-openai`) from the extension catalog; use their `lex-llm-*` counterparts instead.

## [1.9.23] - 2026-05-07

### Fixed
- Fixed encrypted subscription handling to accept both string-keyed and symbol-keyed IV headers before decrypting `encrypted/cs` AMQP payloads.

## [1.9.22] - 2026-05-06

### Changed
- Hot-reloading a `lex-llm-*` provider extension now asks `Legion::LLM::Call::Providers` to rediscover loaded provider modules, keeping LLM provider instances aligned after extension updates.
- Bumped the packaged `legion-llm` dependency floor to `>= 0.9.1` for LLM-owned provider registration and reload-safe registry rebuilds.

## [1.9.21] - 2026-05-06

### Changed
- LegionIO now mounts `Legion::LLM::Routes` through the library route selector when `legion-llm` is available, leaving LLM API ownership with `legion-llm` instead of registering partial fallback routes first.
- LLM provider health API and CLI output now require native `Legion::LLM::Inventory` data and return a clear unavailable response when inventory is not loaded.
- Bumped packaged dependency floors to `legion-llm >= 0.9.0` and `legion-data >= 1.8.0` for the coordinated LLM route/schema sweep.

### Fixed
- Lite and local mode startup now write development mode through the public `Legion::Settings.set_prop` API.

### Removed
- Removed active `lex-llm-gateway` fallback paths from LLM chat, provider health, extension catalog, role filtering, and README documentation.

## [1.9.20] - 2026-05-06

### Fixed
- Nested LEX extensions now merge default settings into their nested `extensions` path (for example `lex-foo-bar` -> `extensions.foo.bar`) while underscored flat extensions continue to use the flat key (for example `lex-foo_bar` -> `extensions.foo_bar`).
- Extension load-time settings checks now use the discovered settings path for nested extensions, keeping `enabled`, `min_version`, `workers`, and `remote_invocable` overrides aligned with where defaults are merged.

## [1.9.19] - 2026-05-05

### Added
- `UnrecoverableMessageError` for messages that should be dead-lettered immediately (e.g., missing IV header on encrypted messages) instead of retried.
- Subscription actors now extract `message_id` and `correlation_id` from AMQP metadata into the message hash for downstream tracing.
- Runner builder auto-includes `Helpers::Lex` into runner modules when available, ensuring all runners have LEX metadata helpers.

### Fixed
- Encrypted messages (`encrypted/cs`) with a missing `iv` header now raise `UnrecoverableMessageError` and are dead-lettered rather than crashing with a nil argument to `Crypt.decrypt`.

## [1.9.18] - 2026-04-29

### Fixed
- API-submitted LLM tools now build native `Legion::LLM::Types::ToolDefinition` objects instead of attempting to require RubyLLM at runtime.
- Provider route coverage now locks LegionIO's `/api/llm/providers` compatibility response ahead of later colliding LLM library route registrations.

## [1.9.17] - 2026-04-29

### Fixed
- LegionIO now requires `legion-llm >= 0.8.47` and only uses a local sibling `legion-llm` checkout when it satisfies that release floor, preventing stale local worktrees from breaking Bundler resolution.
- Native LLM provider health API responses now preserve model, type, health, and instance fields when inventory offerings are loaded from string-keyed data.

## [1.9.16] - 2026-04-28

### Fixed
- LegionIO now requires `legion-llm >= 0.8.44` so packaged installs include the unified identity migration for LLM caller metadata and Broker token audit context.

## [1.9.15] - 2026-04-28

### Fixed
- The static extension catalog now classifies `lex-llm-gateway` as legacy compatibility, and setup pack tests explicitly prevent it from returning to default LLM or agentic installs.
- README LLM documentation now calls out `lex-llm-gateway` as legacy-only compatibility glue that is not installed by default.

## [1.9.14] - 2026-04-28

### Fixed
- LegionIO now requires `legion-tty >= 0.5.4` so packaged installs include the Legion-native LLM probe instead of the legacy direct RubyLLM probe.

## [1.9.13] - 2026-04-28

### Fixed
- LegionIO now requires `legion-llm >= 0.8.43` so packaged installs get the optional RubyLLM compatibility layer and native dispatch fallback defaults.

## [1.9.12] - 2026-04-28

### Fixed
- LegionIO now requires `legion-llm >= 0.8.42` so packaged installs resolve the validated LLM routing uplift release.

## [1.9.11] - 2026-04-28

### Fixed
- LLM chat API routing now prefers native `Legion::LLM.chat` even when legacy `lex-llm-gateway` compatibility code is loaded.

## [1.9.10] - 2026-04-28

### Fixed
- LLM provider health endpoints and CLI health checks now use the native `legion-llm` provider inventory before falling back to legacy `lex-llm-gateway` provider stats.

## [1.9.9] - 2026-04-28

### Fixed
- Registry governance and security scanning now accept nested `lex-*` extension gem names such as `lex-llm-openai` and `lex-llm-azure-foundry`.

## [1.9.8] - 2026-04-28

### Fixed
- The `agentic` setup pack now installs the Legion-native `lex-llm-*` provider stack without also installing retired legacy LLM provider gems.
- Role profiles now treat `lex-llm-*` gems as the active AI extension set and exclude legacy LLM providers from default `core`, `dev`, and `cognitive` profile loading.
- LegionIO now requires `legion-llm >= 0.8.41` so packaged installs get the router dependency cleanup that removes retired legacy provider runtime dependencies.

## [1.9.7] - 2026-04-28

### Fixed
- Extension discovery now maps `lex-llm-azure-foundry` to `Legion::Extensions::Llm::AzureFoundry` and `legion/extensions/llm/azure_foundry`.
- LegionIO now requires `legion-llm >= 0.8.40` so packaged installs include the native provider bridge needed by the Legion-native LLM stack.
- README LLM provider documentation now describes the `lex-llm-*` provider stack instead of the retired legacy provider list.

## [1.9.6] - 2026-04-28

### Fixed
- LLM API gateway checks now use the `Legion::Extensions::Llm::Gateway` namespace loaded by Legion extension autoloading.
- LLM inference and skill invocation routes now call the current `Legion::LLM::Inference` request/executor API instead of the retired pipeline constants.
- `legionio llm ping` now routes through `Legion::LLM.ask_direct` instead of bypassing Legion routing with a raw RubyLLM call.
- API client tool construction now degrades cleanly when the RubyLLM tool base is unavailable.

## [1.9.5] - 2026-04-28

### Added
- Extension catalog, setup packs, and local development wiring now include the Legion-native `lex-llm` provider stack, including Bedrock, Azure Foundry, and Vertex hosted provider extensions.

### Fixed
- Local development Gemfile wiring now includes guarded `lex-llm-ledger` resolution so the local bundle matches the LLM setup pack.
- Local development Gemfile wiring now points `lex-llm-gateway` at the workspace extension path actually used by LegionIO checkouts.
- Default setup packs no longer install legacy `lex-llm-gateway`; the extension catalog now labels it as compatibility glue rather than active LLM routing.
- `require 'legion/extensions'` now loads its logging dependency directly instead of relying on `require 'legion'` order.

## [1.9.4] - 2026-04-27

### Added
- Extension boot now runs a dedicated LLM load phase so `lex-llm` loads before any `lex-llm-*` extension gems.
- `/api/health` now reports `uptime_seconds` and `uptime` for dashboard and monitor consumers. Fixes #168
- `/api/extensions` now returns a flat loaded-extension summary for dashboard consumers. Fixes #169

### Fixed
- `legionio doctor` no longer reports extension-loader config keys as missing `lex-*` gems. Fixes #157
- `/api/metering` now returns dashboard headline totals instead of the routing breakdown shape. Fixes #170
- Extension autobuild now runs per-extension data migrations when migration files are present, even when an extension does not opt into general data models. Fixes #171
- `/api/webhooks` now loads its `Legion::Webhooks` runtime dependency before route handlers execute. Fixes #172
- `/api/tenants` now passes positional response data and uses `json_error` for missing tenants. Fixes #173

## [1.9.3] - 2026-04-27

### Fixed
- Extension catalog persistence now skips no-op startup updates when the stored state already matches, reducing local SQLite write churn. Fixes #176

## [1.9.2] - 2026-04-27

### Fixed
- `POST /api/knowledge/status` no longer silently defaults to the daemon's cwd. Uses `knowledge.default_corpus_path` setting or `LEGION_CORPUS_PATH` env var; returns 400 when unresolvable. Prevents `Errno::EPERM` crashes on macOS when the daemon is launched from `~` and `Find.find` walks into TCC-protected subdirs like `~/Library/Accounts`.

## [1.9.1] - 2026-04-25

### Added
- Extension runtime handles now expose authoritative active/latest versions, reload state, pending-reload status, hot-reload eligibility, and owned runtime resources through `/api/extension_catalog`.
- Extension dispatch quiescing now blocks API, ingress, and subscription runner dispatch while an extension is stopping or actively reloading.
- `Legion::Tools::Registry.unregister_extension` removes callable tools owned by an extension during unload/reload cleanup.

### Fixed
- Runtime handle `loaded?` no longer reports `stopped` or `failed` extensions as loaded.
- Extension registration publication now happens after extension autobuild and runtime side effects complete, avoiding durable registration of failed loads.
- Extension runtime handles now transition to loaded only after `require` and extension side effects succeed, and multi-segment extension modules keep their hyphenated lex identity.

## [1.9.0] - 2026-04-24

### Added
- `Legion::Identity::Resolver` — composite identity resolution chain with parallel provider execution, DB persistence, and transport event publishing
- `Legion::Identity::Trust` — trust level enum (verified, authenticated, configured, cached, unverified)
- `Legion::Identity::Grant` — frozen value object for credential access auditing
- `Identity::Process` extended with trust, aliases, providers, profile composite state
- `Identity::Broker` upgraded to `[provider, qualifier]` tuple-keyed multi-instance storage with `for_context` routing and bounded async audit queue
- `Resolver.upgrade!` for post-boot identity trust escalation with canonical_name change support
- Settings client name updated from resolved identity for correct queue naming

### Changed
- `setup_identity` gate relaxed to run with DB-only nodes (not just transport)
- `register_credential_providers` gate relaxed for DB-only nodes
- Reload lifecycle: `Resolver.reset!` preserves providers, re-resolves with existing registrations
- Middleware `system_principal` uses Resolver identity when available

### Fixed
- `Request.from_auth_context` canonical normalization now matches DB constraint `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9_-]*$`
- `/api/identity/audit` reads from `identity_audit_log` table instead of `AuditRecord`

### Removed
- Legacy tree-walk identity discovery (`resolve_identity_providers`, `find_identity_providers`, `collect_identity_providers`)
- `identity_provider?` and `register_identity_provider` from extensions.rb

## [1.8.16] - 2026-04-22

### Added
- `legion mind-growth wire ID` CLI command — wires a built extension into the cognitive tick cycle via `Orchestrator.post_build_pipeline`; accepts `--phase` override option

### Fixed
- `MindGrowth#wire` rescue block now logs errors via `Legion::Logging.error` before displaying them, ensuring errors are captured in the daemon log and not only printed to the terminal

## [1.8.15] - 2026-04-22

### Fixed
- `legionio knowledge ingest <file>` no longer returns `API 500 for /api/knowledge/ingest`. Two halves of the same contract mismatch: (a) the CLI previously forwarded `dry_run:` on every call (now only when `--dry-run` is passed), and (b) the `/api/knowledge/ingest` route forwarded `dry_run:` to `Legion::Extensions::Knowledge::Runners::Ingest.ingest_file`, whose signature in `lex-knowledge` 0.6.7 is `ingest_file(file_path:, force:)` — causing `ArgumentError: unknown keyword: :dry_run`. The kwarg remains honored for directory (corpus) ingests, which support preview scans. Adds regression coverage in `spec/legion/cli/knowledge_command_spec.rb` (negative-case for file ingest) and a new `spec/api/knowledge_spec.rb` covering the file/directory/dry_run branches of the route.

## [1.8.14] - 2026-04-18

### Fixed
- Optional subsystem `LoadError`s (RBAC, Data, LLM, Apollo, Gaia, Telemetry) now log at the caller-specified level instead of always ERROR with a full stack trace — `handle_exception` respects the `level:` kwarg. Fixes #155
- `web_fetch` tool in `/api/llm/*` endpoints now delegates to `Legion::CLI::Chat::WebFetch.fetch` instead of bare `Net::HTTP.get`, gaining SSL, redirect-following, HTML-to-markdown conversion, and `maxLength` support. Fixes #153
- `web_search` tool in `/api/llm/*` endpoints no longer falls through to the generic "not executable server-side" error — added dispatch branch delegating to `Legion::CLI::Chat::WebSearch.search`. Fixes #154

## [1.8.13] - 2026-04-17

### Added
- `Absorbers::Base#query_knowledge` — scope-aware knowledge retrieval (`:local`, `:global`, `:all`) with deduplication, matching the pattern established by `Helpers::Knowledge`

### Fixed
- `Absorbers::Base` now routes ingestion by scope: `absorb_to_knowledge`, `absorb_raw`, and `ingest_chunks` resolve `Legion::Apollo::Local` for `:local` scope and `Legion::Apollo` for `:global`, instead of always hitting the global store
- Added `apollo_local_available?` and `resolve_apollo_target` private helpers for scope-driven Apollo target selection

## [1.8.12] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed
- `Actors::Subscription` now supports `pattern` class method as a DSL accessor for routing key hints, delegating to `routing_key_hint` — extensions calling `pattern 'some.routing.key'` no longer raise `NoMethodError`. Fixes #143
- `Absorbers::Base` removed deprecated `alias handle absorb` — use `#absorb` directly
- Generator template (`legion generate absorber`) now emits `def absorb(...)` instead of `def handle(...)`
- `Matchers::File` is now required and registered alongside `Matchers::Url` in the absorber loader
- Absorber base spec updated to use `#absorb` instead of removed `#handle` alias

## [1.8.11] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed
- `Legion::CLI::Chat::WebFetch` — eliminated all remaining polynomial regex patterns (CodeQL `rb/polynomial-redos`): replaced `convert_blocks!`, `convert_headings!`, `convert_lists!`, `convert_formatting!`, and `strip_remaining_tags!` with index-based tag scanning helpers (`replace_tag_blocks!`, `replace_open_tags!`, `replace_close_tags!`, `replace_self_closing!`). No regex with `[^>]*` or `[^>]+` remains in the HTML-to-markdown pipeline.

## [1.8.10] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed
- `Legion::CLI::Chat::WebFetch#convert_links!` polynomial regex on uncontrolled data (CodeQL `rb/polynomial-redos`) — replaced backtracking `<a[^>]*href=...>` regex with index-based scanner that walks tag boundaries without backtracking
- Thor `[WARNING] Attempted to create command` noise during rspec — prepend `RSpec::Mocks::AnyInstance::Recorder` to wrap `observe!`, `mark_invoked!`, `restore_original_method!`, and `remove_dummy_method!` inside `Thor.no_commands_context` when the target class is a Thor subclass

## [1.8.9] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed
- `Legion::DigitalWorker::Registry#emit_blocked` passed positional hash to `Legion::Events.emit` which expects kwargs — caused `ArgumentError` masking intended domain exceptions (`WorkerNotFound`, `WorkerNotActive`, `InsufficientConsent`). Fixes #114

### Added
- `Legion::Audit::HashChain` now includes `seq` in `CANONICAL_FIELDS` and `verify_chain` detects gaps in sequence numbers, preventing undetected record deletion from the tamper-evident audit chain. Backwards-compatible: gap check is skipped when `seq` is absent. Fixes #149

## [1.8.8] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed
- `Legion::Ingress` code injection (CodeQL `rb/code-injection`) — replaced `Kernel.const_get` with allowlist lookup against registered extension modules; `resolve_runner_class` now only resolves classes present in `loaded_extension_modules` or `local_tasks`
- `Legion::Graph::Exporter#to_dot` incomplete string escaping (CodeQL `rb/incomplete-sanitization`) — extracted `dot_escape` helper using char-by-char escaping of backslashes and quotes for DOT labels
- `Legion::CLI::Chat::WebFetch#strip_invisible!` polynomial regex / incomplete sanitization / bad tag filter (CodeQL `rb/polynomial-redos`, `rb/incomplete-multi-character-sanitization`, `rb/bad-tag-filter`) — replaced regex `gsub!` with iterative `strip_tag_blocks!` that finds open/close tags by index, eliminating backtracking and handling malformed closing tags

## [1.8.7] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed
- `Legion::CLI::Chat::WebSearch#extract_real_url` incomplete URL substring sanitization (CodeQL `rb/incomplete-url-substring-sanitization`) — replaced `include?('duckduckgo.com')` with `URI.parse` host check using `end_with?`
- `Legion::Tools::EmbeddingCache.clear` now flushes L1/L2 cache tiers in addition to L0 memory, preventing stale lookups after clear

## [1.8.6] - 2026-04-15

### Added
- `Tools::Base#sticky` accessor — tool classes can opt out of sticky runner injection (defaults `true`)
- `Tools::Discovery` propagates `sticky_tools?` from extension to tool class `sticky` attribute; nil treated as opt-out (conservative)
- `Extensions::Core#sticky_tools?` — defaults `true`, extensions may override with `def self.sticky_tools? false end`

## [1.8.5] - 2026-04-15

### Fixed
- `Legion::Extensions::Core#trigger_words` now defaults to `lex_name.split('_')` (e.g. `['github']` for lex-github) instead of `[]`, ensuring extensions auto-surface in TriggerIndex without requiring explicit declaration. Closes #139
- `Legion::Extensions::Builder::Runners#build_runner_entry` now always populates `trigger_words`, defaulting to `[runner_name]` when the runner module does not define them explicitly. Closes #139
- `Legion::Tools::Discovery#synthesize_functions` now builds a real JSON Schema from Ruby method reflection data (`Method#parameters`) — required kwargs become required schema properties, optional kwargs become optional properties — so the LLM receives accurate parameter information instead of an empty schema. Closes #140
- `Legion::Tools::Discovery#synthesize_functions` now uses `definition[:desc]` for tool description when a `definition` DSL entry exists, falling back to the method name rather than `"method_name function"`. Closes #140
- `Legion::Tools::Discovery#tool_attributes` now reads `definition[:inputs]` when present and non-empty, using it as the input schema in preference to `meta[:options]`. Closes #140
- `Legion::Tools::Discovery#register_function` fixed asymmetric default: `resolve_exposed` now defaults to `true` when the extension does not respond to `mcp_tools?`, matching the behaviour of `resolve_mcp_tools_enabled`. Closes #140

## [1.8.4] - 2026-04-14

### Added
- `legionio fleet` CLI subcommand tree: `status`, `pending`, `approve`, `add`, `config`
- `legionio setup fleet` two-phase command: phase 1 installs fleet gems, phase 2 wires relationships via `Workflow::Loader`, seeds conditioner rules, registers settings via `load_module_settings`, merges LLM routing overrides, applies RabbitMQ planner consumer timeout policy
- Fleet pipeline YAML manifest with 10 relationships (1-8 plus 4b, 4c) connecting assessor, planner, developer, and validator
- `Legion::Fleet::SettingsDefaults` — file-based fleet settings persistence
- `Legion::Fleet::ConditionerRules` — supplementary conditioner rule seeds (skip-planning-trivial, skip-validation-trivial, escalate-max-iterations, critical-production-max-capability, governance-mind-growth)
- Fleet API routes: `POST /api/fleet/sources`, `GET /api/fleet/pending` (filters both `fleet.shipping` and `fleet.escalation`), `POST /api/fleet/approve`, `GET /api/fleet/sources`, `GET /api/fleet/status`

## [1.8.3] - 2026-04-14

### Fixed
- `runner_class` resolution for actors nested under `Actor::` namespace — `sub(/Actor$/, 'Runners')` only matched `Actor` at end-of-string, failing for `Extension::Actor::ClassName` patterns (e.g., `Health::Actor::Watchdog`, `Node::Actor::Beat`). Changed to `sub(/::Actor::/, '::Runners::')` which matches the path segment. Affects 9+ actors across lex-health, lex-node, lex-tasker, lex-conditioner, lex-transformer.
- Added defensive guard in `manual` method — raises descriptive `NoMethodError` when `runner_class` resolves to the actor itself and the function is not defined, instead of a generic undefined method error.

## [1.8.2] - 2026-04-13

### Added
- `Legion::Extensions::Actors::RetryPolicy` — configurable retry threshold module with `should_retry?`, `extract_retry_count`, and `retry_threshold` helpers
- Subscription actor `reject_or_retry` — counts retries via `x-retry-count` header, republishes with incremented header and exponential backoff (`2^n * base_delay`, capped at `max_delay`), dead-letters to DLX when threshold exceeded
- Settings: `fleet.poison_message_threshold` (primary), `transport.retry_threshold` (fallback), `fleet.transport.retry_base_delay_seconds`, `fleet.transport.retry_max_delay_seconds`

## [1.7.37] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- Trigger word tool injection: extensions and runners declare trigger words that auto-promote deferred tools when detected in LLM messages
- `Legion::Tools::TriggerIndex` — Concurrent::Map-backed reverse index for O(1) trigger word lookup
- `trigger_words` DSL on Extensions::Core, runner modules, and Tools::Base
- also fixed the stupid thor rspec issue

## [1.8.0] - 2026-04-12

### Added
- `Legion::Extensions::Builder::Skills` — parallel to `Builders::Runners`, discovers and registers `lex-skill-*` gems into `Legion::LLM::Skills::Registry` at boot
- `Legion::Extensions::Core` — `skills_required?` guard; extensions declaring this flag are skipped when legion-llm is not loaded
- `Legion::Chat::Skills` rewritten — delegates to `Legion::LLM::Skills::Registry` instead of YAML file discovery; `discover` returns an Array of skill objects
- `Legion::API::Skills` — REST endpoints: `GET /api/skills`, `GET /api/skills/:namespace/:name`, `POST /api/skills/invoke`, `DELETE /api/skills/active/:conversation_id`
- `Legion::CLI::SkillCommand` rewritten — delegates to daemon API instead of local YAML parsing; `list`, `show`, `run` subcommands
- `Legion::Extensions::Builder::Skills` wired into `Extensions::Core#autobuild` after `Builders::Runners`

## [1.7.36] - 2026-04-09

### Changed
- `Legion::Python::VENV_DIR` reads `LEGION_PYTHON_VENV` env var first, falls back to `~/.legionio/python`

## [1.7.35] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- `Legion::Python` central module — single source of truth for venv paths, package list, and interpreter resolution
- `legionio setup python` CLI command for creating/repairing Python venv with document/data packages
- `PythonEnvCheck` doctor check for Python venv health
- Homebrew packaging note: `LEGION_PYTHON` and `LEGION_PYTHON_VENV` are exported by Homebrew wrapper scripts in the companion tap, not by changes in this gem repository

### Fixed
- `notebook create` crash: removed `python:` kwarg that `Generator.generate` does not accept (`ArgumentError`)
- `docs serve` now uses `Legion::Python.interpreter` instead of inline path resolution

## [1.7.33] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- Phase 8 prerequisites: `Broker.lease_for(name)` returns raw Lease, `Broker.renewer_for(name)` returns LeaseRenewer
- `LeaseRenewer` now exposes `attr_reader :provider` for structured credential access
- Non-renewing registration path: static API key providers (expires_at: nil, renewable: false) stored in `Concurrent::AtomicReference` without background LeaseRenewer thread
- `Broker.refresh_credential(name)` for manual refresh of static credentials
- `Broker.providers` and `Broker.leases` include both dynamic and static registrations
- `register_provider_with_broker` in service.rb — winning auth provider auto-registered with Broker after identity resolution

### Changed (Copilot review #126)
- Renamed extension catalog routes from `/api/extensions` to `/api/extension_catalog` to eliminate route conflict with LexDispatch's `GET /api/extensions/:lex_name/:component_type/:component_name/:method_name` wildcard
- Updated `GET /api/extension_catalog/available` (was `/api/extensions/available`)
- Updated OpenAPI spec paths and `list_extensions` chat tool to match new route prefix
- Froze individual entry hashes in `Catalog::Available::EXTENSIONS` via `.each(&:freeze).freeze`; `all`, `by_category`, and `find` now return dup copies to prevent caller mutation
- Added explicit `require 'legion/api/helpers'` and `require 'legion/api/extensions'` to `spec/legion/api/extensions_spec.rb` for deterministic spec loading
- Added `loader.settings[:data]`, `[:transport]`, and `[:extensions]` initialization to extensions spec `before(:all)` for isolation

## [1.7.32] - 2026-04-09

### Changed
- Rewrote `/api/extensions` routes to use in-memory state from `Catalog` instead of database queries — no `require_data!` dependency
- All extension routes now use `:name` (string identifier like `lex-node`) instead of numeric `:id` params
- Added `GET /api/extensions/available` route backed by `Catalog::Available.all` (static ecosystem list, filterable by `?category=`)
- Added `Legion::Extensions::Catalog::Available` module with 120+ known LEX gems organized by category
- Extension helper methods (`find_extension_module`, `find_runner_info`, `runner_summaries`, `halt_not_found`) moved into `Legion::API::Helpers` for reuse across all API tests

## [1.7.31] - 2026-04-08

### Added
- Phase 7 RBAC enrichment: `Identity::Request` gains `roles:` constructor kwarg, `#roles` reader, `#id` alias for `principal_id`, and `roles:` in `identity_hash`
- `Identity::Middleware#build_request` now separates `claims[:groups]` (group OIDs/names) from `claims[:roles]` (Entra app roles), fixing the pre-existing conflation via `||`
- Worker token principal_id now correctly uses `claims[:worker_id]` when present, preventing worker tokens owned by a human from sharing the human's RBAC identity
- `Identity::Middleware` enriches resolved roles via `Legion::Rbac::GroupRoleMapper` when legion-rbac is loaded and enabled (including audit mode)
- `Identity::Middleware` builds `env['legion.rbac_principal']` (a `Legion::Rbac::Principal`) after setting `env['legion.principal']`, bridging identity to RBAC
- Middleware mount order fix: `Legion::Rbac::Middleware` removed from class-level `use` in `api.rb`; both `Identity::Middleware` and `Rbac::Middleware` now registered in `service.rb#setup_api` in the correct order (Identity first, then RBAC)

### Changed
- `Legion::Identity::Request.from_auth_context` now reads `claims[:resolved_roles]` to populate `roles`

## [1.7.30] - 2026-04-08

### Added
- SSE streaming inference now emits real-time `tool-call`, `tool-result`, `tool-error`, and `model-fallback` events via `executor.tool_event_handler` as tools execute (with wall-clock `startedAt`/`finishedAt`/`durationMs` timing)
- `event: done` payload extended with `conversation_id`, `stop_reason`, `cache_read_tokens`, and `cache_write_tokens` fields (nil values compacted out)
- Post-hoc `model-fallback` events emitted from `pipeline_response.warnings` for non-streaming tool paths
- `admin purge-topology` CLI command to remove stale v2.0 `legion.*` AMQP exchanges that have `lex.*` counterparts
- Parallel tool execution in `CLI::Chat::DaemonChat`: all tools in a response now run concurrently via `Thread.new`, preserving original order for message replay
- `build_tool_result_object` now carries `tool_call_id`/`id` so the Interlink frontend can match results to tool calls by ID rather than name (fixes parallel same-type tool matching)

### Changed
- SSE tool-call events now use camelCase keys (`toolCallId`, `toolName`, `args`) matching the Interlink wire protocol

## [1.7.29] - 2026-04-07

### Changed
- Skip secret resolution for all CLI commands that only need local settings: `config`, `mode`, `lex`, `doctor`, `auth`, `marketplace`, `debug`, `failover status` — eliminates noisy Vault/lease warnings on local-only operations

## [1.7.28] - 2026-04-07

### Fixed
- `legionio setup` pack marker and packs.json writes now rescue `Errno::EPERM`/`EACCES`, fixing Homebrew post-install crash when sandbox blocks writes to `~/.legionio/`

## [1.7.27] - 2026-04-07

### Changed
- `Connection.ensure_settings` accepts `resolve_secrets:` keyword (default `true`) to skip Vault/lease resolution for CLI commands that don't need infrastructure credentials
- `legionio update` now skips secret resolution, eliminating noisy "Vault not connected" and "LeaseManager not available" warnings

## [1.7.26] - 2026-04-07

### Added
- Phase 5 Credential Scoping — service.rb integration (§8 of `docs/plans/2026-04-07-credential-scoping-design.md`)
- Boot: call `Legion::Crypt.fetch_bootstrap_rmq_creds` after `Crypt.start` to acquire short-lived bootstrap RMQ credentials from Vault before transport connects (no-op when `dynamic_rmq_creds: false`)
- `setup_identity`: after identity resolves, call `Legion::Crypt.swap_to_identity_creds(mode:)` to swap from bootstrap to identity-scoped RMQ credentials — gated on `vault_connected? && dynamic_rmq_creds? && !lite?`; fallback identity still gets scoped creds
- `shutdown`: call `Legion::Crypt.revoke_bootstrap_lease` before Crypt shutdown for defense-in-depth lease cleanup
- `reload`: call `fetch_bootstrap_rmq_creds` after Crypt.start, `resolve_secrets!` after settings reload, and `setup_identity` (replacing static `mark_ready(:identity)`) so reloaded processes acquire identity-scoped credentials
- Specs for all Phase 5 service.rb integration paths: boot credential fetch, identity swap per mode, vault/flag/lite guards, swap failure recovery, shutdown revocation, reload credential flow

## [1.7.25] - 2026-04-06

### Added
- Wire Format Phase 3 Group 2: `Identity::Request::SOURCE_NORMALIZATION` constant — maps middleware-emitted source values (`:api_key`, `:local`, `:jwt`, `:kerberos`, `:system`) to canonical credential enum at `from_auth_context` construction time
- Wire Format Phase 3 Group 2: `response_meta` in `API::Helpers` now includes `caller` block (`canonical_name`, `kind`, `source`) when the request is authenticated and `env['legion.principal']` is set by `Identity::Middleware`
- Wire Format Phase 3 Group 2: `POST /api/llm/inference` wires `to_caller_hash` from the authenticated principal into the pipeline `caller:` field, replacing the hardcoded `{ type: :user, credential: :api }` fallback

## [1.7.24] - 2026-04-06

### Fixed
- `Routes::Events` SSE stream: qualify `stream_queue` call with `Routes::Events.` to fix NoMethodError on Legion::API instance

### Added
- `Identity::Process.source` accessor — exposes provider source in identity hash (Wire Format Phase 3)
- `source:` key in `Identity::Process.identity_hash`, `bind!`, `bind_fallback!`, and `EMPTY_STATE`

## [1.7.22] - 2026-04-06
### Added
- Elastic APM integration for Sinatra API via `elastic-apm` gem
- Full APM config under `api.elastic_apm` settings: server_url, api_key, secret_token, api_buffer_size, api_request_size, api_request_time, capture_body, capture_headers, capture_env, disable_send, enabled, environment, hostname, ignore_url_patterns, pool_size, service_name, service_node_name, service_version, sample_rate
- `setup_apm` / `shutdown_apm` lifecycle in Service (boot, shutdown, reload)
- `ElasticAPM::Middleware` wired into API when available
- Health/ready endpoints excluded from APM tracing by default

## [1.7.21] - 2026-04-06
### Fixed
- Optional components (rbac, llm, apollo, gaia) no longer block readiness when not installed
- Split `Readiness::COMPONENTS` into `REQUIRED_COMPONENTS` and `OPTIONAL_COMPONENTS`
- Added `Readiness.mark_skipped` for components that are absent or disabled
- Reload path now correctly marks optional components as skipped when not loaded

## [1.7.20] - 2026-04-06
### Added
- `Legion::Mode` module with `LEGACY_MAP`, ENV/Settings fallback chain, `agent?`/`worker?`/`infra?`/`lite?` predicates
- `Legion.instance_id` — UUID computed at load time, ENV override via `LEGIONIO_INSTANCE_ID`
- `Legion::Identity::Process` singleton — process identity with `bind!`, `bind_fallback!`, `queue_prefix` per-mode, `AtomicReference` thread safety
- `Legion::Identity::Request` — per-request immutable identity with `from_env`, `from_auth_context`, `to_caller_hash`, `to_rbac_principal`
- `Legion::Identity::Lease` — credential lease value object with `expired?`, `stale?` (50% TTL), `ttl_seconds`, `valid?`
- `Legion::Identity::LeaseRenewer` — background thread per provider, 50% TTL renewal, cooperative shutdown (no `Thread#kill`)
- `Legion::Identity::Broker` — provider management with groups cache (60s TTL, single-flight CAS), `token_for`, `credentials_for`, `shutdown`
- `Legion::Identity::Middleware` — Rack middleware bridging `legion.auth` to `legion.principal` (`Identity::Request`)
- `setup_identity` boot step 9 — parallel provider resolution via `Concurrent::Promises`, fallback to `ENV['USER']`
- Extension publish suppression — defers `LexRegister.publish` until identity resolves, `flush_pending_registrations!`
- Identity provider auto-registration during phased extension load (`identity_provider?` duck-type check)
- `GET /api/identity/audit` route with principal and duration filtering
- `legion doctor` checks: `ApiBindCheck` (non-loopback without auth), `ModeCheck` (no explicit process.mode)

### Changed
- `Readiness.status` upgraded to `Concurrent::Hash` for thread safety; `:identity` added to `COMPONENTS`
- `READONLY_SECTIONS` extended with `:identity`, `:rbac`, `:api`
- Default API bind changed from `0.0.0.0` to `127.0.0.1`
- `ProcessRole` delegates `.current` to `Mode.current`; added `:agent` and `:infra` role entries
- `lite_mode?` delegates to `Mode.lite?`
- Reload path adds `Identity::Process.refresh_credentials` after transport reconnect
- Shutdown adds cooperative `Identity::Broker.shutdown` and JWKS background refresh stop

## [1.7.19] - 2026-04-06

### Added
- `ALWAYS_LOADED` constant in `Tools::Discovery` — pins apollo/knowledge and eval/evaluation runners to always-loaded regardless of extension DSL
- `always_loaded_names` method on `Tools::Registry` returning names of all non-deferred registered tools

### Changed
- Tool name format changed from dot-separated to dash-separated (`legion-ext-runner-func`) for LLM provider compatibility
- Reduced noisy debug logging in `Tools::Discovery` and `Tools::Registry`

## [1.7.18] - 2026-04-06

### Added
- Multi-phase extension loading: identity providers (`lex-identity-*`) load in phase 0 before all other extensions in phase 1
- `identity` category in extension registry with prefix matching for `lex-identity-*` gems at tier 0, phase 0
- `group_by_phase` method groups discovered extensions by phase from the category registry
- `load_phase_extensions` replaces `load_extensions` — scopes parallel loading to a subset of entries per phase
- `hook_phase_actors` replaces `hook_all_actors` — hooks deferred actors after each phase completes
- Per-phase logging during extension loading shows cumulative actor counts

### Changed
- `hook_extensions` now iterates phases sequentially (phase 0 then phase 1), running full load+hook cycle per phase
- `default_category_registry` includes `phase:` key on all categories; all non-identity categories default to phase 1
- Catalog transitions (`transition(:running)` + `flush_persisted_transitions`) happen after all phases complete
- Reserved prefixes list now includes `identity`

### Added
- `Legion::Tools::Base` - canonical tool base class with DSL
- `Legion::Tools::Registry` - always/deferred tool classification
- `Legion::Tools::Discovery` - auto-discovers tools from extension runners with hierarchical DSL
- `Legion::Tools::EmbeddingCache` - 5-tier persistent embedding cache (L0 memory + Cache + Data)
- `mcp_tools?` and `mcp_tools_deferred?` extension Core DSL
- `runner_modules` accessor on extension builders
- `loaded_extension_modules` accessor on `Legion::Extensions`
- Static tools: `Do`, `Status`, `Config` with `Legion::Logging::Helper`

### Changed
- Boot registers tools into Tools::Registry after extension load
- Embedding index build is async (non-blocking)
- API inference reads from Tools::Registry instead of MCP
- Capability registration methods are now no-ops (replaced by Tools::Discovery)

### Removed
- Direct MCP dependency for tool access in API inference

## [1.7.16] - 2026-04-03

### Fixed
- Inference endpoint now injects daemon MCP tools alongside client tools via class-level cached adapters
- MCP server pre-warmed in background thread during boot to avoid blocking first inference
- Gaia ticks route added to fallback API routes
- Reload endpoint disabled (418) to prevent accidental restart loops

## [1.7.15] - 2026-04-03

### Added
- Every actors now support `delay` method to defer timer start (used by lex-microsoft_teams)
- Request logger emits `[api][request-start]` on inbound, warns on responses > 5s

### Changed
- `/api/reload` disabled (returns 418) to prevent accidental full-restart loops

## [1.7.14] - 2026-04-03

### Fixed
- Actor boot ordering: once → poll → every → loop → subscriptions, preventing timer actors from competing with AMQP channel setup
- Builder now respects `remote_invocable? false` and skips auto-generated subscription actors for local-only extensions
- Catalog exchange cached and reused instead of creating a new channel + exchange_declare per transition
- Catalog SQLite persists batched into a single transaction at end of boot instead of per-transition writes from concurrent threads

## [1.7.13] - 2026-04-03

### Changed
- Bump legion-crypt >= 1.5.1, legion-transport >= 1.4.14, legion-cache >= 1.3.22

## [1.7.12] - 2026-04-03

### Fixed
- Fixes #110: normal daemon boot now prefers library-owned LLM and Apollo API routes, `/api/tenants` uses canonical JSON parsing with correct status codes, SSE listeners drain worker threads on disconnect, paginated collections avoid unconditional `COUNT(*)` unless explicitly requested, and service startup skips duplicate settings loads once configuration is already bootstrapped

## [1.7.11] - 2026-04-02

### Fixed
- Fixes #113: webhook deliveries now retry non-2xx responses and transport exceptions up to `max_retries`, record per-attempt delivery rows, dead-letter terminal failures, and cache active webhook pattern matching to reduce per-event dispatch overhead

## [1.7.10] - 2026-04-02

### Changed
- Bumped minimum dependency floors for Legion core gems, including `legion-logging >= 1.5.0`, `legion-settings >= 1.3.25`, and updated transport, data, cache, crypt, Apollo, and MCP minimums
- Stabilized the `LegionIO` spec suite by fixing the OAuth callback, catalog, and service shutdown regression specs
- CLI startup now honors settings-driven log levels, normalizes `start --help` into the standard Thor help flow, and routes chat/error logging through the newer helper-backed logger path
- `Legion::Service`, telemetry, and webhook runtime paths now use structured helper logging more consistently, respect configured logging when no CLI override is passed, and avoid brittle settings reads during boot
- Extension runtime wiring now deep-dups merged settings, lazily registers the local `extension_catalog` migration, publishes catalog transitions directly to transport, and surfaces auto-binding failures more clearly
- Secret, region, and task-outcome helpers now use canonical Vault connectivity checks, cache metadata misses more safely, and create meta-learning domains on demand before recording learning episodes

## [1.7.8] - 2026-04-01

### Added
- `Legion::API::Settings` module with registered defaults via `merge_settings('api', ...)`, matching the pattern used by all other LegionIO gems
- Puma `persistent_timeout` (20s) and `first_data_timeout` (30s) now configurable via `Settings[:api][:puma]`

### Changed
- Removed all inline `||` and `.fetch(..., default)` fallbacks for API settings in `service.rb` and `check_command.rb` — defaults now guaranteed by `merge_settings`

## [1.7.7] - 2026-04-01

### Changed
- Integrated legion-logging 1.4.3 Helper refactor: all log output now uses structured segment tagging, colored exception output, and thread-local task context
- Slimmed `Extensions::Helpers::Logger` to thin override; `derive_component_type`, `lex_gem_name`, `gem_spec_for_lex`, `log_lex_name` now live in legion-logging gem
- Added `handle_runner_exception` for runner-specific exception handling (TaskLog publish + HandledTask raise)
- Added `Legion::Context.with_task_context` and `.current_task_context` for thread-local task propagation
- Wrapped all 5 dispatch paths (Runner.run, Subscription#dispatch_runner, Base#runner, Ingress local/remote) with context propagation
- Migrated 13 `log.log_exception` call sites to `handle_exception` across actors, core, transport, and task helpers

## [1.7.6] - 2026-04-01

### Changed
- `POST /api/llm/inference` now routes through `Legion::LLM::Pipeline::Executor` instead of raw `Legion::LLM.chat` session, enabling the full 18-step pipeline (RBAC, RAG context, MCP discovery, metering, audit, knowledge capture)
- GAIA bridge added: user prompt from `/api/llm/inference` is pushed as an `InputFrame` to the GAIA sensory buffer when GAIA is started
- SSE streaming support added: `stream: true` + `Accept: text/event-stream` returns `text/event-stream` with `text-delta`, `tool-call`, `enrichment`, and `done` events
- `build_client_tool` renamed to `build_client_tool_class`; now returns a `Class` (not an instance) so the pipeline can inject it correctly via `tool.is_a?(Class)` check
- Typed error mapping added: `AuthError` → 401, `RateLimitError` → 429, `TokenBudgetExceeded` → 413, `ProviderDown`/`ProviderError` → 502

## [1.7.5] - 2026-04-01

### Added
- `POST /api/reload` endpoint to trigger daemon reload from CLI mode command
- `GET /api/mesh/status` and `GET /api/mesh/peers` endpoints with 10s cache
- `GET /api/metering`, `/api/metering/rollup`, `/api/metering/by_model` endpoints wired to lex-metering
- `GET /api/webhooks` and `GET /api/tenants` routes registered (were defined but never mounted)
- Knowledge monitor v2/v3 route aliases for Interlink compatibility
- Server-side MCP tool injection into `/api/llm/inference` via `McpToolAdapter` (64 tools)
- Deferred tool loading: 18 always-loaded tools, ~46 on-demand (cuts inference from 24s to 6-9s)
- Client-side tools (`sh`, `file_read`, `list_directory`, etc.) now execute server-side in the inference endpoint

### Fixed
- Knowledge ingest API route calls `ingest_content` instead of `ingest_file` when `content` body param is present
- Catalog API queries `extensions.name` instead of non-existent `gem_name` column
- Inference endpoint tool declarations use `RubyLLM::Tool` subclass with proper `name` instance method
- Prompts API guards against missing `prompts` table (returns 503 instead of 500)
- All API rescue blocks use `Legion::Logging.log_exception` instead of swallowing errors

### Fixed
- Puma no longer steals SIGINT/SIGTERM traps, preventing graceful shutdown (#91)

## [1.6.47] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- CLI chat identity wiring: `DaemonChat` generates stable `conversation_id` and resolves user identity into `caller_context` (Kerberos principal -> ENV['USER'] fallback)
- `DaemonChat` forwards `caller` and `conversation_id` to daemon inference endpoint
- GAIA observation hook in `chat_command.rb`: `setup_gaia_observation` registers an `:llm_complete` callback that ingests user messages into GAIA's observation pipeline
- `:llm_complete` session event now includes `user_message` in payload

## [1.6.46] - 2026-03-31

### Fixed
- `write_pack_marker` no longer uses `FileUtils.touch` — avoids `EPERM` (`Operation not permitted @ apply2files`) on macOS Sequoia when marker file already exists

## [1.6.45] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- `Legion::CLI::ApiClient` shared module — extracts api_get/api_post/api_put/api_delete helpers into a reusable mixin for all CLI commands that talk to the daemon API
- `/api/knowledge/*` API routes — query, retrieve, ingest, status, health, maintain, quality, and monitor CRUD endpoints for lex-knowledge

### Changed
- `legionio knowledge` commands now route through the local API instead of loading extension classes directly (fixes NameError when daemon not running)
- `legionio schedule` commands now route through the existing `/api/schedules/*` API instead of querying Sequel models directly
- `legionio codegen` commands now route through the existing `/api/codegen/*` API instead of checking `defined?` guards that always fail in CLI context
- `legionio absorb` commands now use the shared `ApiClient` module instead of inline HTTP helpers

## [1.6.44] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- `legionio setup <pack>` now writes `~/.legionio/.packs/<name>` marker file and `~/.legionio/settings/packs.json` on successful install, enabling automatic pack reinstall after `brew upgrade` (companion to homebrew-tap#19)

## [1.6.43] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- `POST /api/absorbers/dispatch` API endpoint for async absorber dispatch — CLI no longer loads extension classes directly
- Absorb dispatch runs in a background thread, returning job ID immediately

### Changed
- `legionio absorb url` now routes through the local API instead of loading extension classes in-process (fixes `NameError` when extensions not loaded in CLI context)
- CLI absorb output updated to show async dispatch status with job ID

## [1.6.42] - 2026-03-31

### Fixed
- `Every` and `Poll` actors now guard against overlapping executions using `Concurrent::AtomicBoolean` — if the previous tick is still running when the next interval fires, the new tick is skipped with a debug log instead of stacking up concurrent executions

## [1.6.41] - 2026-03-30

### Fixed
- Add missing `info` method to `Legion::CLI::Output::Formatter` — `auth teams` command called `out.info(...)` but the method did not exist, raising `NoMethodError`

## [1.6.40] - 2026-03-30

### Fixed
- `Helpers::Lex` now includes Cache, Transport, Task, and Data helpers so all actors, runners, absorbers, and hooks automatically get `cache_connected?`, `transport_connected?`, `data_connected?`, `generate_task_id`, and related methods
- `Absorbers::Base` now includes `Helpers::Lex` (previously included zero helpers, causing `NoMethodError` for `log`, `cache_connected?`, etc.)

## [1.6.39] - 2026-03-30

### Added
- `legionio config reset` subcommand to wipe all JSON config files from settings directory (#88)
- `legionio bootstrap --clean` flag to clear settings before import (#88)

### Changed
- `legionio bootstrap` no longer runs `ConfigScaffold` when a source is provided — scaffolded empty files were conflicting with imported config (#88)

## [1.6.38] - 2026-03-30

### Removed
- Remove deprecated `lex-cortex` from agentic setup pack (replaced by legion-gaia)

## [1.6.37] - 2026-03-30

### Added
- TBI Patterns API: `POST /api/tbi/patterns/export`, `GET /api/tbi/patterns`, `GET /api/tbi/patterns/:id`, `PATCH /api/tbi/patterns/:id/score`, `GET /api/tbi/patterns/discover` (501 stub)
- TBI Pattern model and local migration (`create_tbi_patterns`)
- OpenInference telemetry integration (`Legion::Telemetry::OpenInference`)

### Fixed
- Governance lifecycle integration specs expanded and hardened

## [1.6.36] - 2026-03-29

### Added
- Knowledge helper: `knowledge_connected?`, `knowledge_global_connected?`, `knowledge_local_connected?` status methods
- Knowledge helper: `knowledge_default_scope` and `knowledge_default_tags` LEX-overridable layered defaults
- LLM helper: now includes `Legion::LLM::Helper` following cache/transport pattern (with LoadError guard)
- Wrapper specs for cache and data helpers

### Fixed
- Logger helper: add missing `include Base` (was relying on transitive inclusion via Lex)
- Task helper: add missing `include Base`
- Knowledge helper: add missing `include Base`, `knowledge_default_tags` auto-merged into `ingest_knowledge`

## [1.6.35] - 2026-03-29

### Added
- `Legion::Workflow::Manifest` — YAML workflow manifest parser with validation
- `Legion::Workflow::Loader` — installs/uninstalls workflow chains via lex-lex registry
- `legion workflow` CLI — install, list, uninstall, status subcommands
- `workflows/autonomous-github-lifecycle.yml` — sample workflow manifest for codegen pipeline

## [1.6.34] - 2026-03-29

### Fixed
- `POST /api/logs` no longer raises `NoMethodError: undefined method 'values' for nil` — replaced `Legion::Transport::Messages::Dynamic.new(...).publish` with a direct `Legion::Transport::Exchanges::Logging` publish call; `Dynamic` requires a `function_id` for database lookup which log payloads do not have
- `legion knowledge` CLI commands (`require_monitor!`, `require_knowledge!`, `require_ingest!`, `require_maintenance!`) now use `Connection.ensure_knowledge` to dynamically load `lex-knowledge` when not yet loaded, instead of raising a generic error

### Added
- `Connection.ensure_knowledge` — lazily loads the `lex-knowledge` gem on demand, consistent with `ensure_llm` and other lazy loaders

## [1.6.33] - 2026-03-28

### Added
- `knowledge` registered as top-level CLI subcommand (previously only accessible via `legionio ai knowledge`). Fixes knowledge capture hooks that call `legionio knowledge capture commit/transcript`.

### Fixed
- Claude Code hook format in `setup claude-code`: PostToolUse and Stop hooks now emit the new `hooks` array wrapper format with `type: command` entries. Detection supports both old and new formats via `hook_commands` helper.

## [1.6.32] - 2026-03-28

### Added
- `POST /api/logs` endpoint (`Routes::Logs`) — accepts `error`/`warn` level messages from CLI, normalizes with server-side metadata (timestamp, node, legion_versions, ruby_version, pid), computes `error_fingerprint` via `EventBuilder.fingerprint` when `exception_class` is present, and publishes to the `legion.logging` exchange with routing key `legion.logging.exception.{level}.cli.{source}` or `legion.logging.log.{level}.cli.{source}`
- `Legion::CLI::ErrorForwarder` module — fire-and-forget HTTP helper that POSTs CLI errors/warnings to the daemon API; silently swallows all failures so daemon unavailability never crashes the CLI
- `ErrorForwarder.forward_error` wired into both rescue blocks in `CLI::Main.start` (fires before `exit(1)`)

## [1.6.31] - 2026-03-28

### Fixed
- `build_hook_list` in `Builders::Hooks` now calls `runner_class` on a hook instance (instance method) instead of the class, preventing the `TypeError: no implicit conversion of nil into String` boot crash caused by `Helpers::Base#runner_class` being inherited at the class level and calling `sub!` on a string that contains no `'Actor'` substring
- `Helpers::Base#runner_class` changed `sub!` to `sub` (non-destructive) as a defensive fix — `sub!` returns `nil` when no substitution is made, which caused `Kernel.const_get(nil)` to raise `TypeError`
- Runner reference returned by `hook_class.new.runner_class` is now resolved safely: string class names are resolved via `Kernel.const_defined?` + `Kernel.const_get`; Class objects are used directly; `nil` falls back to `hook_class`

## [1.6.30] - 2026-03-28

### Fixed
- `Legion::Extensions::Hooks::Base` now defines the `mount(path)` DSL method and `mount_path` reader — fixes `NoMethodError` boot crash in any extension hook that calls `mount` (e.g. `lex-microsoft_teams` `Hooks::Auth`)

## [1.6.29] - 2026-03-28

### Removed
- `ClassMethods` module (`expose_as_mcp_tool`, `mcp_tool_prefix`) from `Legion::Extensions::Helpers::Lex` — deprecated since the definition DSL was introduced; zero extensions use them

### Fixed
- Fallback route guards in `api.rb` now check `router.library_names.include?` instead of `defined?` — prevents 404s when gem modules are loaded but routes are not yet mounted (fixes #53)

## [1.6.28] - 2026-03-28

### Fixed
- `legion lex list` now displays extensions in clean aligned tables with Name, Version, Status, Runners, Actors columns
- Grouped view drops redundant category/tier columns from rows (already shown in group header); sorts alphabetically within each group
- Flat/category-filtered view uses Name, Version, Category, Status, Runners, Actors columns; sorts alphabetically
- Runners and actors are formatted as comma-joined names (up to 3) or a count summary instead of raw `Array#to_s` output
- JSON output for both flat and grouped list modes is now handled directly in the render methods

## [1.6.27] - 2026-03-28

### Fixed
- `Connection.ensure_crypt` now calls `resolve_secrets!` a second time after `Legion::Crypt.start` so that `lease://` URI refs are resolved once the LeaseManager is running (closes #50)

## [1.6.26] - 2026-03-28

### Added
- Absorber Router registration: `builders/absorbers.rb` now registers absorbers with `Legion::API.router` for v3.0 API discovery and dispatch (component_type: `absorbers`)
- Hook-aware LexDispatch: `POST /api/extensions/:lex/hooks/:name/:method` applies verify/route/transform lifecycle for `Hooks::Base` subclasses; auto-generated hooks pass through unchanged
- Transport message auto-generation: `auto_generate_messages` in `extensions/transport.rb` creates `Legion::Transport::Message` subclasses from runner definitions with inputs at boot time; explicit classes always take precedence
- `legion broker purge-topology` CLI command: detects old v2.0 AMQP exchanges (`legion.*`) that have v3.0 counterparts (`lex.*`) and optionally deletes them via RabbitMQ management API; defaults to `--dry-run`
- `spec/api/lex_dispatch_spec.rb`: 10-example spec covering v3.0 LexDispatch routes (replaces old lex_spec.rb)
- `spec/api/lex_dispatch_hooks_spec.rb`: 5-example spec for hook-aware dispatch (401/422/success/passthrough)
- `spec/api/old_systems_removed_spec.rb`: 10-example spec verifying old registries are gone
- `spec/cli/admin_command_spec.rb`: 21-example spec for topology detection logic
- `spec/extensions/builders/absorbers_spec.rb`: 10-example spec for absorber builder + Router registration
- `spec/extensions/transport_auto_messages_spec.rb`: 14-example spec for message auto-generation
- `unless defined?` guards on `Routes::Gaia`, `Routes::Transport`, `Routes::Rbac` registration for library gem self-registration

### Removed
- `Routes::Lex` (`api/lex.rb`): old `/api/lex/*` wildcard dispatcher — use `/api/extensions/:lex/runners/:name/:method`
- `Routes::Hooks` (`api/hooks.rb`): old `/api/hooks/lex/*` handler — use `/api/extensions/:lex/hooks/:name/:method`
- `Legion::API.hook_registry`, `.register_hook`, `.find_hook`, `.find_hook_by_path`, `.registered_hooks` — hooks auto-register via builder
- `Legion::API.route_registry`, `.register_route`, `.find_route_by_path`, `.registered_routes` — routes auto-register via builder

### Changed
- Routes builder log message now uses v3.0 path format (`/api/extensions/...` instead of `/api/lex/...`)

## [1.6.25] - 2026-03-28

### Added
- `Legion::Extensions::Absorbers::Dispatch`: module-function dispatch pipeline — `dispatch(input, context:)`, depth limiting, cycle detection via ancestor_chain, `dispatch_children`, `extract_urls`, thread-safe `@dispatched` registry
- `Legion::Extensions::Absorbers::PatternMatcher`: URL/file pattern registry — `register(absorber_class)`, `resolve(input)`, priority-ordered matching, `reset!`
- `Legion::Extensions::Absorbers::Transport`: v3.0 AMQP topology — `publish_absorb_request`, `build_message`, `lex_name_from_absorber_class`, `absorber_name_from_class`; exchanges named `lex.{lex_name}`, routing keys `lex.{lex_name}.absorbers.{name}.absorb`
- `Legion::Extensions::Absorbers::Base`: updated with `TokenRevocationError`, `TokenUnavailableError`, and `with_token(provider:, &block)` helper for OAuth-gated absorbers
- `Legion::Extensions::Absorbers::Matchers::File`: file-path pattern matcher using `File.fnmatch`
- `Legion::Auth::OauthCallback`: ephemeral TCP server for OAuth redirect callback — `wait_for_callback`, `parse_callback`; per-port lifecycle
- `Legion::Auth::TokenManager`: `TokenExpiredError`, `mark_revoked!`, `revoked?` for token lifecycle and revocation detection
- `Legion::CLI::ConnectCommand`: `legion connect microsoft`, `legion connect github`, `legion connect status`, `legion connect disconnect` — browser OAuth flow entry points registered as `legion connect` subcommand
- Chat URL detection: `Session#check_for_absorbable_urls` auto-dispatches matched URLs after each user message
- `spec/integration/absorber_pipeline_spec.rb`: 12-example end-to-end integration spec covering PatternMatcher resolution, Dispatch routing, transport suppression in lite mode, absorber → Apollo.ingest pipeline, depth/cycle guards

## [1.6.24] - 2026-03-28

### Added
- `Legion::API.register_library_routes(gem_name, routes_module)` class method: library gems self-register their Sinatra route modules at boot via `router.register_library` + Sinatra `register`. Implemented in `lib/legion/api/library_routes.rb`.
- `Legion::API::SyncDispatch.dispatch(exchange_name, routing_key, payload, envelope, timeout:)`: synchronous AMQP dispatch using a temporary exclusive reply_to queue with configurable timeout (default 30s). Implemented in `lib/legion/api/sync_dispatch.rb`.
- Remote dispatch in `LexDispatch`: when a registered extension route's runner class is not loaded in the current process, the request is forwarded via AMQP — async (202) by default or sync (blocks on reply queue) when `X-Legion-Sync: true` header is present. Returns 403 when `definition[:remote_invocable] == false`.
- `Routes::Llm` and `Routes::Apollo` registration now guarded: skipped in `api.rb` when `Legion::LLM::Routes` / `Legion::Apollo::Routes` are already defined (i.e. self-registered by the library gem).

### Changed
- `api.rb`: requires `api/library_routes` and `api/sync_dispatch`; LLM and Apollo route registration conditional on gem self-registration not already having run.

## [1.6.23] - 2026-03-28

### Added
- `Legion::Extensions::Definitions` mixin: class-level `definition` DSL for method contracts (`desc`, `inputs`, `outputs`, `remote_invocable`, `mcp_exposed`, `idempotent`, `risk_tier`, `tags`, `requires`). Auto-extended onto every runner module at boot by the builder.
- `Legion::Extensions::Actors::Dsl` mixin: `define_dsl_accessor` generates class-level getter/setter DSL with inheritance and instance delegation. Wired into all actor base classes (`Every`, `Poll`, `Subscription`, `Once`, `Base`).
- `Absorbers::Base#absorb`: canonical entry point replacing `handle`. `alias handle absorb` preserves backward compatibility.

### Changed
- `Builders::Runners#build_runner_list`: auto-extends `Legion::Extensions::Definitions` onto every discovered runner module unless it already responds to `:definition`.
- `Hooks::Base`: extended with `Definitions` mixin; `mount` DSL removed (paths fully derived from naming).
- `Absorbers::Base`: extended with `Definitions` mixin.
- `AbsorberDispatch`: calls `absorber.absorb` instead of `absorber.handle`.
- `Helpers::Lex`: all `function_*` helpers and `expose_as_mcp_tool`/`mcp_tool_prefix` marked `@deprecated` — use `definition` DSL instead.

## [1.6.22] - 2026-03-27

### Added
- `POST /api/llm/inference` daemon endpoint: accepts a full messages array plus optional tool schemas, runs a single LLM completion pass, and returns `{ content, tool_calls, stop_reason, model, input_tokens, output_tokens }` — the client owns the tool execution loop
- `Legion::CLI::Chat::DaemonChat` adapter: drop-in replacement for the `RubyLLM::Chat` object that routes all inference through the daemon, executes tool calls locally, and loops until the LLM produces a final text response
- `spec/legion/api/llm_inference_spec.rb`: 12 examples covering the new `/api/llm/inference` endpoint
- `spec/legion/cli/chat/daemon_chat_spec.rb`: 25 examples covering `DaemonChat` initialization, tool registration, tool execution loop, streaming, and error handling

### Changed
- `legion chat setup_connection`: replaced `Connection.ensure_llm` (local LLM boot) with a daemon availability check via `Legion::LLM::DaemonClient.available?` — **hard fails with a descriptive error if the daemon is not running**
- `legion chat create_chat`: now returns a `DaemonChat` instance instead of a direct `RubyLLM::Chat` object; all LLM calls route through the daemon

## [1.6.21] - 2026-03-27

### Added
- `legionio knowledge capture transcript` CLI command: ingests Claude Code session transcripts into Apollo knowledge store
- Stop hook for automatic transcript capture at session end (installed via `legion setup claude-code`)

## [1.6.20] - 2026-03-27

### Changed
- Bump `legion-logging` dependency to `>= 1.4.0` (required for `log_exception`, writer lambdas)

### Fixed
- `subscription.rb` (both `on_delivery` and `subscribe` blocks): initialize `fn = nil` before `process_message` so the rescue interpolation never raises `NameError` if message processing fails before `fn` is assigned
- `Helpers::Logger#lex_name` removed to avoid overriding `Helpers::Base#lex_name` (underscore contract used by settings/routing); renamed to private `log_lex_name` used only within this module for gem name derivation
- `Helpers::Logger#handle_exception`: use `spec&.version&.to_s` so nil spec version produces `nil` rather than `""` in structured log output
- README: update version badge from `v1.6.18` to `v1.6.20`

## [1.6.19] - 2026-03-27

### Fixed
- `teardown_logging_transport`: rescue block in `setup_logging_transport` now calls `teardown_logging_transport` to clean up any partially-created `@log_session` on failure
- `teardown_logging_transport`: guard `open?` call with `respond_to?(:open?)` check to avoid `NoMethodError` on session objects that do not implement the method
- `service_logging_transport_spec`: early-return specs now assert `create_dedicated_session` was not called and `@log_session` remains nil, rather than the vacuous `respond_to(:call)` check
- `service_logging_transport_spec`: replaced vacuous `not_to eq(owner)` assertion with `have_received(:create_dedicated_session)` to verify the dedicated session was actually created

## [1.6.18] - 2026-03-27

### Added
- `setup_logging_transport`: dedicated AMQP session for log and exception forwarding, replacing the previous `register_logging_hooks` approach; writer lambda wiring is gated by `Settings[:logging][:transport]` feature flags
- `teardown_logging_transport`: cleanly shuts down the dedicated logging AMQP session during the shutdown sequence

### Changed
- Split `log.error(e.message); log.error(e.backtrace)` patterns replaced with `log.log_exception` across 14 files for structured, single-call exception logging
- `Extensions::Helpers::Logger#handle_exception` rewritten to use `log.log_exception` with full lex context

### Fixed
- `legionio pipeline image analyze`: `call_llm` no longer passes unsupported `messages:` keyword to `Legion::LLM.chat`; now creates a chat object and sends multimodal content via `chat.ask`, returning a plain hash with `:content` and `:usage` keys
- `legionio ai trace search/summarize`: both commands now call `setup_connection` before invoking `TraceSearch`, ensuring `Legion::LLM` is booted so `TraceSearch.generate_filter` can use structured LLM output instead of returning "no filter generated"; added `class_option :config_dir` and `class_option :verbose` to `TraceCommand`

## [1.6.17] - 2026-03-27

### Fixed
- `legionio check`: `resolve_secrets!` is now called after a successful crypt check so `lease://`, `vault://`, and `env://` credential URIs are resolved before transport/data checks attempt to connect
- `legionio check transport`: raises an early descriptive error when transport credentials are still unresolved URI references (Vault lease pending), instead of failing with a confusing connection error
- `legionio check data`: raises an early descriptive error when database credentials are still unresolved URI references (Vault lease pending)
- `legionio llm status/providers/models`: `boot_llm_settings` now calls `resolve_secrets!` so `env://` and `vault://` API key references are resolved before provider enabled-state is evaluated
- `legionio llm providers`: providers with unresolved credential URIs are now shown as `deferred (credentials pending Vault)` in yellow instead of incorrectly `disabled`
- `Connection.ensure_settings`: calls `resolve_secrets!` after loading settings so `env://` references are resolved in all CLI commands that use the lazy connection manager

## [1.6.16] - 2026-03-27

### Fixed
- `config validate` transport host check now reads from `transport.connection.host` instead of `transport.host` (correct config nesting)
- `doctor diagnose` now loads settings via `Connection.ensure_settings` before running checks, so cache/database/vault/extensions checks no longer skip due to `Legion::Settings` being undefined; also adds `ensure Connection.shutdown` for clean teardown

## [1.6.15] - 2026-03-27

### Added
- Absorbers: new LEX component type for pattern-matched content acquisition
- `Absorbers::Base` class with `pattern`/`description` DSL and knowledge helpers (`absorb_to_knowledge`, `absorb_raw`, `translate`, `report_progress`)
- `Absorbers::Matchers::Base` auto-registering matcher interface with `Matchers::Url` for URL glob matching
- `Absorbers::PatternMatcher` for thread-safe input-to-absorber resolution with priority-based dispatch
- `Builders::Absorbers` for auto-discovery of absorber classes during extension boot
- `Capability.from_absorber` factory method for Capability Registry integration
- `AbsorberDispatch` module for pattern resolution and handler execution
- `legionio absorb` CLI command with `url`, `list`, and `resolve` subcommands
- `legionio dev generate absorber` scaffolding template

## [1.6.14] - 2026-03-27

### Added
- `Legion::Compliance` module rewritten with DEFAULTS hash, `merge_settings` registration, and clean API
- `Compliance.setup` registers max-classification defaults: PHI, PCI, PII, FedRAMP all enabled by default
- `Compliance.enabled?`, `.phi_enabled?`, `.pci_enabled?`, `.pii_enabled?`, `.fedramp_enabled?` convenience methods
- `Compliance.classification_level` returns `'confidential'` by default (highest level)
- `Compliance.profile` returns a hash with all compliance flags for downstream consumers
- `setup_compliance` wired into Service boot sequence after settings load
- Compliance profile spec (8 examples)

### Changed
- `Compliance.phi_enabled?` now uses `Settings.dig(:compliance, :phi_enabled)` instead of chaining `[]` calls
- Existing PhiTag and PhiAccessLog specs updated to use `merge_settings` instead of stubbing `Settings.[]`

## [1.6.13] - 2026-03-27

### Added
- `DigitalWorker.heartbeat` method for updating worker health status and last heartbeat timestamp
- `DigitalWorker.detect_orphans` method to find workers with stale or nil heartbeats
- `DigitalWorker.pause_orphans!` method to auto-pause orphaned workers with event emission
- Consent tier sync on lifecycle transitions: `worker.update` now includes `consent_tier` from `CONSENT_MAPPING`
- `Lifecycle.sync_consent_tier` calls `lex-consent` runner when available, graceful degradation when not
- Per-worker SSE events at `/api/workers/:id/events?stream=true` with queue-per-client filtering
- Polling fallback for per-worker events via ring buffer filtering (default mode)

## [1.6.11] - 2026-03-26

### Added
- `Legion::Dispatch` module with pluggable strategy interface and `Local` implementation using `Concurrent::FixedThreadPool`
- Local dispatch wiring in `extensions.rb`: `dispatch_local_actors` registers non-remote extensions in thread pool
- `Ingress.local_runner?` short-circuit: runners for `remote_invocable? false` extensions skip AMQP round-trip
- `setup_dispatch` in `Service` boot sequence with graceful shutdown
- `legion broker stats` and `legion broker cleanup` CLI commands for RabbitMQ management
- End-to-end integration test for TBI Phase 5 self-generating functions loop (9 examples)
- Test dependencies: lex-codegen, lex-eval added to Gemfile for integration testing
- Specs for `legion codegen` CLI subcommand (8 subcommands, 22 examples)
- Specs for `/api/codegen/*` API routes (8 routes, 20 examples)
- Specs for `setup_generated_functions` boot loading in Service (4 examples)

### Fixed
- Guard `Legion::Transport::Messages::Dynamic` stub definition in integration spec with `unless defined?` to prevent redefinition conflicts when real implementations are present
- Wrap `lex-codegen` and `lex-eval` requires in `LoadError` rescue guards in integration spec; sets `LEGION_CODEGEN_EXTENSION_AVAILABLE` / `LEGION_EVAL_EXTENSION_AVAILABLE` flags and skips entire example group via `before(:all)` when extensions are unavailable
- Move `Legion::LLM.chat` stub to `RSpec.configure before(:each)` block so it always intercepts regardless of whether the real `legion-llm` gem is loaded, preventing external LLM calls in integration tests
- Fix `service_setup_apollo_spec` "starts Apollo::Local" example: stub `Legion::Apollo.start` to prevent internal double-call of `Apollo::Local.start`

## [1.6.10] - 2026-03-26

### Changed
- `ConfigImport.write_config` now splits recognized subsystem keys (`microsoft_teams`, `rbac`, `api`, `logging`, `gaia`, `extensions`, `llm`, `data`, `cache_local`, `cache`, `transport`, `crypt`, `role`) into individual `{key}.json` files
- Remaining unrecognized keys written to `bootstrapped_settings.json` (replaces `imported.json`)
- Subsystem files are always overwritten on bootstrap; remainder file respects `--force` for merge behavior
- `write_config` returns an array of written paths instead of a single path
- `legion bootstrap` and `legion config import` updated to display per-file write confirmations

## [1.6.9] - 2026-03-26

### Added
- `Helpers::Secret` mixin with `SecretAccessor` for per-user and per-lex Vault KV v2 secret access
- Identity resolution chain: Kerberos principal -> Entra UPN -> explicit user -> ENV['USER']
- `secret[:name]` / `secret[:name] = { ... }` / `secret.write` / `secret.exist?` / `secret.delete`
- `shared: true` option for extension-scoped (non-user) secrets

## [1.6.8] - 2026-03-26

### Added
- `legionio bootstrap SOURCE` command: combines `config import`, `config scaffold`, and `setup agentic` into one command
- Pre-flight checks for klist (Kerberos ticket), brew availability, and legionio binary
- `--skip-packs`, `--start`, `--force`, `--json` flags for bootstrap command
- Self-awareness system prompt enrichment: `Context.to_system_prompt` appends live metacognition self-narrative from `lex-agentic-self` when loaded; guarded with `defined?()` and `rescue StandardError`

## [1.6.7] - 2026-03-26

### Fixed
- `setup_generated_functions` now runs only when `extensions: true` (inside the extensions gate) preventing unexpected boot side-effects in CLI flows that disable extensions
- Consumer tag entropy upgraded from `SecureRandom.hex(4)` (32-bit) to `SecureRandom.uuid` (122-bit) in both `prepare` and `subscribe` paths of subscription actor, eliminating the theoretical RabbitMQ `NOT_ALLOWED` tag collision

## [1.6.4] - 2026-03-26

### Fixed
- fix consumer tag collision on boot: subscription actors using `Thread.current.object_id` produced duplicate tags when `FixedThreadPool` reused threads, causing RabbitMQ `NOT_ALLOWED` connection kill and cascading errors; replaced with `SecureRandom.hex(4)`

## [1.6.3] - 2026-03-26

### Changed
- `legionio update` now uses `gem outdated` instead of custom HTTP client to check rubygems.org
- Remove `concurrent-ruby`, `net/http`, `json` dependencies from update command
- 4 persistent keep-alive connections replaced by single `gem outdated` call (~8s, 100% reliable)

## [1.6.2] - 2026-03-26

### Fixed
- `legionio update` remote check failed for all gems due to TCP connection exhaustion (24 parallel SSL connections to rubygems.org)
- Replace thread pool with 4 batched threads using persistent HTTP keep-alive connections (55 gems in ~4s)

## [1.6.1] - 2026-03-26

### Fixed
- `legionio update` now shows "(remote check failed)" instead of "(already latest)" when rubygems.org fetch fails
- Add HTTP timeouts (5s connect, 10s read) to remote version checks to prevent thread pool exhaustion
- Install failures now show "(install may have failed)" instead of "(already latest)"
- Distinct statuses: current, check_failed, installed, failed (was single ambiguous "updated" for all)

## [1.6.0] - 2026-03-26

### Added
- `legion codegen` CLI subcommand (status, list, show, approve, reject, retry, gaps, cycle)
- `/api/codegen/*` API routes for generated function management
- Boot loading for generated functions via GeneratedRegistry
- Function metadata DSL (function_outputs, function_category, function_tags, function_risk_tier, function_idempotent, function_requires, function_expose)
- ClassMethods for MCP tool exposure (expose_as_mcp_tool, mcp_tool_prefix)
- End-to-end integration test for self-generating functions
- `legion knowledge monitor add/list/remove/status` — multi-directory corpus monitor management
- `legion knowledge capture commit` — capture git commit as knowledge (hook-compatible)
- `legion knowledge capture session` — capture session summary as knowledge (hook-compatible)
- `legion setup claude-code` now installs write-back hooks for automatic knowledge capture
- `resolve_corpus_path` falls back to first registered monitor when no explicit path given

## [1.5.23] - 2026-03-26

### Changed
- Remove all lex-memory references from service.rb, API coldstart, and OpenAPI docs; use lex-agentic-memory namespace everywhere

## [1.5.22] - 2026-03-26

### Fixed
- `coldstart ingest` no longer crashes when lex-memory is absent; uses lex-agentic-memory trace store instead

### Changed
- Consolidate 48 root CLI commands into 7 groups + 19 root commands
- New groups: `ai`, `git`, `pipeline`, `ops`, `serve`, `admin`, `dev`
- `ai`: chat, llm, gaia, apollo, knowledge, memory, mind-growth, swarm, plan, trace
- `git`: commit, pr, review
- `pipeline`: skill, prompt, eval, dataset, image, notebook

## [1.5.21] - 2026-03-26

### Changed
- `legionio setup agentic` now installs the full cognitive stack (63 gems): core libs, all agentic domains, all AI providers, and key operational extensions
- Added `brains` and `give-me-all-the-brains` as aliases for the `agentic` subcommand

## [1.5.20] - 2026-03-26

### Added
- `legion knowledge health` — local/Apollo/sync health report
- `legion knowledge maintain` — orphan chunk detection and cleanup (dry-run by default)
- `legion knowledge quality` — hot/cold/low-confidence chunk quality report

## [1.5.19] - 2026-03-26

### Added
- `legion knowledge` CLI subcommand: query, retrieve, ingest, status (closes #36)
  - `legion knowledge query QUESTION` — synthesized LLM answer + ranked source chunks
  - `legion knowledge retrieve QUESTION` — raw source chunks without synthesis
  - `legion knowledge ingest PATH` — ingest file or directory corpus
  - `legion knowledge status` — show corpus file count and size

## [1.5.18] - 2026-03-25

### Added
- `scope:` parameter on `Helpers::Knowledge` (`ingest_knowledge` and `query_knowledge`)
- Scope routing: `:local` -> `Apollo::Local`, `:global` -> `Apollo`, `:all` -> both with local-first dedup
- Default query scope configurable via `Settings[:apollo][:local][:default_query_scope]`
- `setup_apollo` now starts `Apollo::Local` when available

## [1.5.17] - 2026-03-25

### Added
- `Helpers::Knowledge` — universal `ingest_knowledge` and `query_knowledge` mixin for all extensions; included automatically in `Extensions::Core`
- Automatic file extraction via `Legion::Data::Extract` when a file path is passed to `ingest_knowledge`
- Graceful degradation when `Legion::Apollo` or `Legion::Data::Extract` are not available
- `setup_apollo` in `Service` boot sequence (between LLM and GAIA); wires `Legion::Apollo.start` with `LoadError`/`StandardError` rescue
- `:apollo` added to `Readiness::COMPONENTS` between `:llm` and `:gaia`
- `legion-apollo >= 0.2.1` dependency in gemspec
- `Helpers::LLM#llm_embed` in LegionIO now forwards all keyword arguments (`provider:`, `dimensions:`, etc.) via anonymous `**` forwarding

## [1.5.15] - 2026-03-25

### Removed
- CLI chat Apollo writeback prototype (replaced by pipeline step 19 in legion-llm)

## [1.5.14] - 2026-03-25

### Fixed
- Shutdown no longer hangs when network is unreachable — all component shutdowns wrapped in bounded timeouts via `shutdown_component` helper (#30)
- Reload path also wrapped with same timeout guards to prevent hangs during network-triggered reload (#30)

### Added
- Network watchdog: background `Concurrent::TimerTask` monitors transport/data/cache connectivity, pauses actors after sustained failures, triggers `Legion.reload` when network restores (#30)
- `Legion::Extensions.pause_actors` suspends all `Every` timer tasks without destroying instances (#30)
- Watchdog is feature-flagged via `network.watchdog.enabled` (default: false), configurable threshold and interval (#30)

## [1.5.13] - 2026-03-25

### Fixed
- API startup no longer spams Puma banner on port conflict — pre-checks port with lightweight TCP probe before attempting Puma boot
- Reduced API bind retries from 10 to 3 (6s total vs 30s) so boot completes quickly when port is occupied
- Daemon remains fully functional (shutdown, Ctrl+C) even when API fails to bind

## [1.5.12] - 2026-03-25

### Added
- `GET /api/stats` endpoint — comprehensive daemon runtime stats: extensions (loaded/actor counts), gaia (status/channels/phases), transport (session/channels), cache/cache_local (pool stats), llm (provider health/routing), data/data_local (pool/tuning via legion-data stats), api (puma threads/routes)

### Changed
- Bumped gemspec dependency: legion-data >= 1.6.0 (required for `Legion::Data.stats`)

## [1.5.11] - 2026-03-25

### Added
- `legionio debug` command — full diagnostic dump (16 sections: versions, doctor, config, gems, extensions, RBAC, LLM, GAIA, transport, events, Apollo, remote/local Redis, PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, API health) output as markdown or JSON, suitable for piping to an LLM session
- `legionio update --cleanup` flag — removes old gem versions after update via `Gem::Uninstaller` (default: no cleanup)

### Fixed
- `update_command.rb` `snapshot_versions` now uses `find_all_by_name` + max version instead of `find_by_name`, which returned the already-activated (potentially stale) gem version
- `service.rb` `setup_api` guard prevents duplicate Puma start when `@api_thread` is already alive

### Changed
- Bumped gemspec dependencies: legion-data >= 1.5.3, legion-gaia >= 0.9.24, legion-llm >= 0.5.8, legion-tty >= 0.4.35

## [1.5.10] - 2026-03-25

### Changed
- Guard bootsnap behind `LEGION_BOOTSNAP=true` env var in `exe/legion` and `exe/legionio`, default to disabled
- Bootsnap also requires `~/.legionio` to exist (prevents premature directory creation on first run)

## [1.5.9] - 2026-03-25

### Fixed
- `Subscription#activate` nil guard — skip activate when `@consumer` is nil (prepare failed silently)
- `Extensions#shutdown` tracks real actor instances in `@running_instances`, cancels them with deadline-based drain
- `Extensions::Helpers::Base` runner_class derivation improvements for self-contained actors

### Changed
- Bumped gemspec dependencies: legion-cache >= 1.3.16, legion-settings >= 1.3.19, legion-transport >= 1.4.0, legion-mcp >= 0.5.1

## [1.5.8] - 2026-03-24

### Added
- `Legion::Compliance::PhiTag` — PHI data classification tagging with `phi?`, `tag`, `tagged_cache_key` methods; gated by `compliance.phi_enabled` setting
- `Legion::Compliance::PhiAccessLog` — PHI access audit bridge that calls `Legion::Audit.record` with `event_type: 'phi_access'`; gated by `compliance.phi_enabled` setting
- `Legion::Compliance::PhiErasure` — orchestrates cryptographic erasure via `Legion::Crypt::Erasure`, cache key purge, access log, and verification; all steps guarded by `defined?` checks

## [1.5.7] - 2026-03-24

### Added
- `Legion::Audit::Archiver` — tiered hot/warm/cold audit retention orchestrator; delegates hot→warm to `Legion::Data::Retention`, exports warm→cold as compressed JSONL via `ColdStorage`, records manifests, verifies hash chain after each run
- `Legion::Audit::ColdStorage` — upload/download abstraction with `:local` (filesystem) and `:s3` (aws-sdk-s3, optional) backends; raises `BackendNotAvailableError` when aws-sdk-s3 not installed
- `Legion::Audit::ArchiverActor` — thread-based weekly scheduled actor with hour/day-of-week cron guard; started by `Service#setup_audit_archiver` after telemetry
- `legion audit archive --dry-run / --execute` — preview or execute tiered archival from CLI
- `legion audit verify_chain --tier --start --end` — direct hash chain integrity check for hot or warm tier
- `legion audit restore --date` — restore cold JSONL archives back to warm tier for querying
- Feature flag: `audit.retention.enabled` (default `false`); settings: `hot_days`, `warm_days`, `cold_years`, `cold_storage`, `cold_backend`, `archive_schedule`, `verify_on_archive`

### Changed
- `Legion::Service` starts `CertRotation` after `Crypt.start` when `security.mtls.enabled: true`
- `Legion::Service#shutdown` stops `CertRotation` before `Crypt.shutdown`
- `setup_mtls_rotation` gracefully handles missing mtls support in older `legion-crypt` versions via `LoadError` rescue

## [1.5.6] - 2026-03-24

### Changed
- `Service#register_logging_hooks` uses dedicated `log_channel` from `Connection` instead of shared channel; passes `channel:` to `Exchanges::Logging` to avoid contention
- `Service#reload` re-setup sequence now includes `register_logging_hooks`, cache re-setup, and guarded `setup_rbac`/`setup_llm`/`setup_gaia` calls
- `Readiness::COMPONENTS` expanded with `:rbac` and `:llm` for accurate startup tracking
- LLM and GAIA boot blocks gated so `mark_ready` only fires on success path
- `Cache` and `Data` boot blocks wrap remote failures with graceful fallback to local adapters

## [1.5.5] - 2026-03-24

### Added
- `Legion::Service#setup_api`: optional Puma TLS via `api.tls.enabled` feature flag (default false); falls back to plain HTTP if cert/key missing
- `Legion::CLI::Doctor::TlsCheck`: `legion doctor` check for TLS configuration across all components (transport, data, api)
- `config/tls/settings-tls.json`: complete TLS settings template for all components
- `config/tls/generate-certs.sh`: dev self-signed CA + server/client cert generator
- `config/tls/README.md`: TLS setup and validation instructions

## [1.5.4] - 2026-03-24

### Added
- `Cluster::Leader` wired into `Service` boot behind `cluster.leader_election` feature flag (default: off)
- `Actors::Singleton` upgraded to dual-backend (Redis + PG advisory locks via `Cluster::Lock`)
- `Singleton` gating controlled by `cluster.singleton_enabled` feature flag (default: off — every node runs, no behavior change)
- `Cluster::Lock.extend_lock` method (Redis: Lua TTL extend; PG: always true; none: false)
- `Singleton` mixin added to lex-health watchdog and lex-metering cleanup/cost_optimizer actors

### Changed
- `@cluster_leader.stop` called on `Service#shutdown` (before extensions shutdown)

## [1.5.3] - 2026-03-24

### Added
- Extinction escalation verification in lifecycle integration tests (stub_const approach)
- De-escalation on worker resume: `transition!` calls `Client#deescalate` when extinction level decreases
- Credential revocation on worker termination: calls `VaultSecrets.delete_client_secret` guarded by `defined?`
- Ownership transfer integration tests with event and audit verification
- Retirement cycle integration tests with full audit chain and extinction L3/L4 coverage

## [1.5.2] - 2026-03-24

### Fixed
- `check_cache_local` in CLI now reads display values from `Legion::Settings[:cache_local]` instead of static code defaults

## [1.5.1] - 2026-03-24

### Added
- Wire lex-extinction into digital worker lifecycle transitions
- `EXTINCTION_MAPPING` maps lifecycle states to containment levels (0-4)
- Guarded `Client#escalate` call during `transition!` when containment level increases

## [1.5.0] - 2026-03-24

### Added
- `legion setup agentic` — install full cognitive stack (legion-gaia + legion-llm + all transitive deps) in one command
- `legion setup llm` — install LLM routing only
- `legion setup channels` — install channel adapters (lex-slack, lex-microsoft_teams)
- `legion setup packs` — show installed/missing feature packs
- `--dry-run` flag on all pack install commands
- `legion detect` now recommends `legion setup agentic` when legion-gaia or legion-llm are missing
- `legionio version --full` displays all installed lex-* extension versions
- `legionio version` now lists all 13 legion-* gems with `(not installed)` for missing ones

### Changed
- Overhaul `legionio check` with proper namespace labels (Legion::Settings, Legion::Transport, etc.)
- Each check returns connection detail strings (config dir, amqp:// URL, driver -> servers, adapter -> host:port/db)
- Add Legion::Cache::Local and Legion::Data::Local checks with dependency chaining
- Fix dependency skip logic to cascade through transitive dependencies (skip-on-skip, not just skip-on-fail)
- Add privacy mode sub-check (`legionio check --privacy`)
- Comment out Bootsnap.setup in exe/legion (matching exe/legionio)
- Bump gemspec minimum: legion-data >= 1.5.0

### Fixed
- Runner log output now tagged with extension name (e.g. `[mesh][Runner]` instead of bare `[Runner]`)
- Extension Transport and Routes builders use tagged `log` helper instead of bare `Legion::Logging`
- Runner.run now sets `status = 'task.exception'` before calling `handle_exception`, preventing null function/result in CheckSubtask messages when handle_exception raises

## [1.4.198] - 2026-03-24

### Changed
- Comment out Bootsnap.setup in exe/legion (matching exe/legionio)

## [1.4.198] - 2026-03-24

### Changed
- Bump gemspec minimum: legion-transport >= 1.3.11 (InProcess adapter, shutdown hang fix, Helper mixin)
- Bump gemspec minimum: legion-tty >= 0.4.34 (latest fixes)

## [1.4.197] - 2026-03-24

### Changed
- Add debug logging to 8 swallowed `rescue StandardError` blocks in chat tools and session store: ModelComparison, SystemStatus (fetch_health, fetch_ready), SessionStore (generate_summary, read_session_meta), SaveMemory (ingest_to_apollo), GenerateInsights (scheduling_status, llm_status)

## [1.4.196] - 2026-03-24

### Added
- LLM fallback in `legion do` command: when keyword matching (`find_by_intent`) returns no results, classifies intent via `Legion::LLM.ask` against the full Capability Registry catalog
- Graceful degradation: LLM path only activates when both `Legion::LLM` and `Catalog::Registry` are loaded; errors fall through silently

## [1.4.195] - 2026-03-24

### Added
- `legion do "TEXT"` CLI command: natural language intent router that matches free-text to Capability Registry entries and dispatches via daemon API or in-process Ingress
- `DoCommand` module with two resolution paths: daemon HTTP dispatch (like `dream`) and in-process `Registry.find_by_intent` + `Ingress.run` fallback

## [1.4.194] - 2026-03-24

### Added
- `--lite` flag on `legion start` command: sets `LEGION_MODE=lite` and `LEGION_LOCAL=true` env vars, assigns `:lite` process role
- `:lite` process role in `ProcessRole::ROLES`: all subsystems enabled except `crypt: false` (Vault not needed in lite mode)
- `Service#lite_mode?` checks `LEGION_MODE` env var and `settings[:mode]`
- `setup_local_mode` handles lite mode: sets dev flag, loads Transport::Local, loads mock_vault if Crypt is defined

## [1.4.193] - 2026-03-24

### Added
- `legion mind-growth` CLI subcommand with 10 commands: status, propose, approve, reject, build, proposals, profile, health, report, history
- Delegates to `Legion::Extensions::MindGrowth::Client` (lex-mind-growth extension)
- Guards with `require_mind_growth!` — raises `CLI::Error` when extension is not loaded
- Supports `--json` and `--no-color` class options on all subcommands

## [1.4.192] - 2026-03-24

### Fixed
- fix `undefined method 'key?' for module Legion::Settings` in extension loader — use `Legion::Settings[:llm].nil?` instead of `.key?(:llm)` since Settings is a module with `[]` accessor, not a Hash

## [1.4.191] - 2026-03-23

### Changed
- Add `caller: { source: 'cli', command: 'chat' }` to `Legion::LLM.chat` call in `CLI::ChatCommand#create_chat`, completing Wave 5 consumer migration

## [1.4.190] - 2026-03-23

### Changed
- Migrate `Guardrails::RAGRelevancy` to use `Legion::LLM.chat` (public API) instead of the private `chat_single` method
- Add `Guardrails::SYSTEM_CALLER` constant with system pipeline identity to prevent infinite recursion when guardrails calls the LLM through the pipeline
- The `:system` profile skips governance steps (rbac, classification, billing, gaia_advisory, rag_context, context_load) — guardrails is internal infrastructure, not a user request
- Add specs covering `SYSTEM_CALLER` structure and LLM call behavior in `RAGRelevancy`

## [1.4.189] - 2026-03-23

### Changed
- Add `caller:` identity to all LLM calls in API, CLI, extensions, and internal modules
  - `API::Routes::Llm` sync path: `caller: { source: 'api', path: request.path }`
  - `API::Routes::Prompts`: `caller: { source: 'api', endpoint: 'prompts' }`
  - `CLI::Commit`, `CLI::Pr`, `CLI::Review`, `CLI::Prompt`, `CLI::Image`: `caller: { source: 'cli', command: '<cmd>' }`
  - `Notebook::Generator`: `caller: { source: 'cli', command: 'notebook' }`
  - `TraceSearch`: `caller: { source: 'cli', command: 'trace' }`
  - `Extensions` inline LLM runners: `caller: { source: 'extension', command: 'llm_runner' }`

## [1.4.188] - 2026-03-23

### Changed
- Bump legion-mcp dependency to >= 0.5.1

- `unregister_capabilities` removes capabilities from Catalog on extension unload
- `Catalog::Registry.on_change` callback for notifying consumers on registry changes

## [1.4.186] - 2026-03-23

### Fixed
- `CLI::Connection#resolve_config_dir` expands tilde in user-provided `config_dir` before existence check (#25)
- `.github/CODEOWNERS` combined duplicate `*` patterns so both teams are applied (#25)

### Added
- `Service#setup_settings` spec coverage for canonical directory filtering (#25)
- `CLI::Connection` spec for tilde expansion in `config_dir` (#25)

## [1.4.185] - 2026-03-23

### Fixed
- Restrict settings search paths to canonical directories (`~/.legionio/settings`, `/etc/legionio/settings`) (#25)
- Remove broken/dead paths from `Service#default_paths` (`~/legionio`, `$home/legionio`, `./settings`)
- `CLI::Connection#resolve_config_dir` now delegates to `Loader.default_directories` instead of hardcoded list
- Add `legion-settings` local path to Gemfile for development

### Changed

- `Routes::AuthKerberos` module and `api/auth_kerberos.rb` file

## [1.4.77] - 2026-03-19

### Added

## [1.4.70] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- GAIA cognitive layer as a core boot phase: `setup_gaia` runs between LLM and telemetry in the startup sequence
- Two-phase extension loading: all extensions are fully loaded (require + autobuild) before any actors are hooked (AMQP subscriptions, timers, etc.), preventing race conditions during boot
- `gaia: true` parameter on `Service.new` to control GAIA initialization
- GAIA graceful shutdown and reload support (shuts down before extensions, restarts after data)

### Changed
- Boot order is now deterministic: Logging -> Settings -> Crypt -> Transport -> Cache -> Data -> RBAC -> LLM -> GAIA -> Telemetry -> Extensions -> API
- Extension actors are collected into `@pending_actors` during `load_extensions`, then started all at once via `hook_all_actors`

## [1.4.69] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed
- Constant resolution bug in transport/subscription layers: `const_defined?` and `const_get` now pass `inherit: false` to prevent Ruby from finding top-level gem constants (`::Redis`, `::Vault`, `::Data`) through `Object` when checking dynamically created `Module.new` namespaces (`Transport::Exchanges`, `Transport::Queues`)
- `Subscription#queue` now uses `queues.const_get(actor_const, false)` instead of `Kernel.const_get(queue_string)` to search only the Queues module's own constants
- Added `llm-gateway` to `core_extension_names` so it is included under `:core` role profile
- `build_extension_entry` now forces nesting for multi-segment gem names (e.g. `lex-llm-gateway`) to produce correct require paths regardless of call-site `nesting:` argument

## [1.4.68] - 2026-03-19

### Added

  - `llm ping` — test connectivity to each enabled provider with latency measurement
  - All subcommands support `--json` output
- `legionio version` now shows legion-llm, legion-gaia, and legion-tty in components list
- `legionio version --json` now includes components hash and extension count

### Fixed
- `legionio update` now correctly detects gem version changes (was showing "already latest" for every gem due to stale in-memory gem spec cache after subprocess install)

## [1.4.67] - 2026-03-18

### Added
- `legionio detect` subcommand — scan environment and recommend extensions (requires lex-detect gem)
  - `detect scan` (default) — show detected software and recommended extensions
  - `detect catalog` — show full detection catalog
  - `detect missing` — list extensions that should be installed
  - `--install` flag to install missing extensions after scan
  - `--json` output mode
- `legionio update` now suggests new extensions via lex-detect after updating gems

## [1.4.66] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed

- Doctor permissions check now checks `~/.legionio/` directories instead of `/var/run`

## [1.4.65] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed
- Remove local path references from Gemfile (40 sibling repo paths)

## [1.4.64] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed
- Remove legacy `exe/legion-tty` from legionio gem (conflicts with legion-tty gem executable)
- Explicitly list executables as `legion` and `legionio` in gemspec instead of glob pattern

## [1.4.63] - 2026-03-18

### Added
- `legionio config import SOURCE` command for importing config from URL or local file
- Supports raw JSON and base64-encoded JSON payloads
- Deep merges with existing `~/.legionio/settings/imported.json` (or `--force` to overwrite)
- Displays imported sections and vault cluster count

## [1.4.62] - 2026-03-18

### Added
- `legionio` binary for daemon and operational CLI
- `Legion::CLI::Interactive` Thor class for dev-workflow commands (chat, commit, pr, review, memory, plan, init, tty)
- `legion-tty` as runtime dependency
- Shell completions for both `legion` and `legionio` binaries

### Changed
- `exe/legion` now routes bare invocation to TTY shell, args to Interactive CLI
- `exe/legionio` handles all daemon and operational commands

## [1.4.61] - 2026-03-18

### Added
- Chat persistent settings defaults via `Legion::Settings` (issue #5)
- `chat_setting(*keys)` helper for centralized settings access with error handling
- Settings priority chain: CLI flag > `Legion::Settings.dig(:chat, ...)` > hardcoded default
- Configurable via settings: model, provider, personality, permissions, markdown, incognito, max_budget_usd, subagent concurrency/timeout, headless max_turns
- `chat` subsystem added to `config scaffold` with full template
- `Subagent.configure_from_settings` reads concurrency and timeout from settings
- 22 new specs (19 settings integration + 3 subagent settings)

## [1.4.60] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed
- Empty Enter in chat REPL no longer exits the session; returns empty string instead of nil to disambiguate from Ctrl+D (EOF)

## [1.4.59] - 2026-03-17

### Added
- `remote_invocable?` flag for LEX extensions: when `false`, the auto-generated Subscription actor is skipped (no RabbitMQ queue, no thread pool, no AMQP binding)
- 5-level resolution order: per-runner settings, extension settings, runner class method, extension module method, default `true`
- `@local_tasks` list tracks subscription actors skipped due to `remote_invocable? false` for introspection
- `remote_invocable?` default method added to `Legion::Extensions::Core` and `Legion::Extensions::Actors::Base`
- Fully backward compatible — all existing extensions unaffected

## [1.4.58] - 2026-03-17

### Added
- `legion lex list` now groups output by category (tier order) by default.
- `legion lex list CATEGORY` filters the list to a specific category (e.g., `legion lex list agentic`).
- `--flat` option to `legion lex list` restores the original flat table without grouping.
- `category` and `tier` columns added to the extension table in all display modes.
- `discover_all` now includes `:category` and `:tier` keys in each extension info hash,
  derived via `Legion::Extensions::Helpers::Segments.categorize_gem`.
- Results sorted by tier then name for deterministic ordering.

## [1.4.57] - 2026-03-17

### Added
- `--category` option to `legion lex create`: generates categorized extension gems with nested module
  declarations, nested directory structure, and correct `VERSION` constant paths.
  Example: `legion lex create cognitive-anchor --category agentic` produces gem `lex-agentic-cognitive-anchor`
  with module `Legion::Extensions::Agentic::Cognitive::Anchor`.
- `LexGenerator` now accepts `gem_name:` keyword argument and uses `Legion::Extensions::Helpers::Segments`
  to derive all namespace, const, and require-path values for both flat and nested extensions.
- `legion lex create` emits a warning via `Legion::Extensions.check_reserved_words` when reserved
  category prefixes or framework words are used in the gem name.

## [1.4.56] - 2026-03-17

### Fixed
- `lex_class` now returns the full extension module constant by walking the namespace up to the first `NAMESPACE_BOUNDARIES` word, instead of always stopping at index 2. For nested extensions (`Legion::Extensions::Agentic::Cognitive::Anchor`), this returns `Legion::Extensions::Agentic::Cognitive::Anchor` rather than the incorrect `Legion::Extensions::Agentic`.
- `lex_const` now derives from `lex_class.to_s.split('::').last` so it returns the extension's root constant name (`Anchor`) rather than always returning the third element of the namespace array.
- `full_path` now builds the gem name from dash-joined segments (`lex-agentic-cognitive-anchor`) instead of underscore-joined `lex_name`, so `Gem::Specification.find_by_name` works for nested extensions.

## [1.4.55] - 2026-03-17

### Changed
- `build_default_exchange` now sets `exchange_name` on dynamically created exchange classes to return `amqp_prefix` (dot-joined segments with `legion.` prefix) instead of defaulting to the parent class behavior
- `auto_create_exchange` now derives `exchange_name` from `amqp_prefix` + the exchange's own downcased class name, replacing the index-based `split('::')[5].downcase` extraction that broke for nested extension namespaces

### Fixed
- `legion config scaffold` now writes to `~/.legionio/settings/` by default instead of `./settings/`
- Removed Thor `default: './settings'` that shadowed the Ruby fallback in `ConfigScaffold.run`
- Added `~/.legionio/settings` to `legion config path` search paths to match `Service#default_paths`

## [1.4.54] - 2026-03-17

### Changed
- `Helpers::Logger#log` now passes `lex_segments:` array to `Legion::Logging::Logger` when the object responds to `:segments`
- Falls back to `lex:` string for legacy flat extensions that do not implement `:segments`

## [1.4.53] - 2026-03-17

### Fixed
- Extension discovery now correctly parses multi-hyphenated gem names (e.g., `lex-cognitive-reappraisal`)
- `gem_names_for_discovery` returns structured data instead of ambiguous `name-version` strings
- Updated fallback path to use `Gem::Specification.latest_specs` instead of `all_names`

## [1.4.52] - 2026-03-17

### Added
- `legion dashboard`: TUI operational dashboard with auto-refresh polling

### Added
- `Legion::Graph::Builder`: builds task relationship graph from relationships table with chain/worker filtering

- `GET /api/capacity/forecast`: projected capacity with configurable growth rate and period
- `GET /api/capacity/workers`: per-worker capacity breakdown

## [1.4.47] - 2026-03-17

### Fixed
- `gem_load` rescue block referenced undefined `gem_path` variable, causing secondary NameError that masked original LoadError
- `meta_actors` type guard checked `is_a?(Array)` but called `each_value` (Hash method), so meta actors were never hooked
- `build_actor_list` crashed entire extension load when actor file didn't define expected constant (now skips gracefully)
- `build_transport` raised NoMethodError on extensions with custom Transport modules missing `build` (now falls back to auto-generate)

## [1.4.46] - 2026-03-17

### Added
- `Legion::Telemetry.configure_exporter`: OTLP and console span exporters
- OTLP exporter uses BatchSpanProcessor for production performance
- Settings: `telemetry.tracing.exporter`, `endpoint`, `headers`, `batch_size`

- Auth spec required `legion/rbac` gem directly — replaced with inline stub for standalone test execution

## [1.4.42] - 2026-03-17

### Added
